I hope you enjoyed your holiday weekend! I want to flag for you a potential rejection for Fellow Hirving Henriquez. Our Admissions team has flagged that Hirving has been unable to provide an official, degree-conferred undergraduate transcript that shows proof of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution of higher education. Hirvings transcript conversion is unable to explicitly state that the degree he earned from Universidad Catolica Tecnologica Cibao in the Dominican Republic is equivalent to a U.S. baccalaureate degree. We are still working with the World Education Services to try to get any updates on Hirvings prior educational history, but it appears most likely that we will need to deny him admissions. 

If he is rejected do you know if there is another institution that hed be able to attend? We are very crestfallen at this news from our admissions team as Hirving has shown tremendous potential over summer coursework so far.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks!

Hi Mr. Soponis,

     I hope all is well. My name is Jamecia Forsythe, and I am currently a NYC Teaching Fellow. Recently we were given our university assignments, and I was given St. John's University. Since I have to take care of my father who has prostate cancer (I can provide any necessary medical records/documents regarding his condition if needed), and since I live in Brooklyn, I put in an appeal to my university, requesting that I be put in Brooklyn so that it would be easier for me to take care of my father, while participating in this program. When I got the appeal decision, I was given Relay GSE, but when I saw the class schedule for Relay GSE, I knew instantly that I would have a problem committing to that schedule because there is less flexibility; therefore I contacted a representative from NYCTF and they told me that the only schools that participates my in subject area are Lehman, Relay GSE, and SJU. However, I never knew that those were my only three options because if I did, I would have never put in that appeal because regardless of whatever school I was given, because of the important fact that I could not stay in Brooklyn, and that I would have to venture out regardless. I was never told that Relay GSE, SJU, and Lehman were the only options I had before I put in my appeal, which makes me feel mislead because I never knew my options were limited (because I thought our chances were with all of the schools in the program), and especially because I had no chance of remaining in Brooklyn. Even though the summer coursework has to be in Queens for SJU, I have the opportunity to take the rest of my classes on the Manhattan campus, with the same flexibility; so I would have fought my way through this summer because looking into the long run, this summer is simply a small feat considering the rest of the program; I would have dealt with the commute for the few months because I know that I can take the rest of my courses in Manhattan. SJU would be a better fit because I can schedule classes for one day, and continue to aid with my father. I understand that the university assignments are final, but I feel mislead because I was never able to explore all of my options, and it lead me to make an uneducated decision, that I would have never made if I knew that my options were limited to three schools, as opposed to schools in Brooklyn, let alone, the rest of the schools. I love everything that this program has to offer, and I worked hard to be in it, and I am excited to teach the new generation. I would hate to have to leave the program and have to do the whole process over because of a simple conflict with a school schedule. I am not asking for any leniency for anything within the realm of NYCTF's pre-service training, just a fair chance to have the best fit with the information I was told only after the appeal. Overall, I just would like to know if you can help me so that I can please go back to my original assignment because it SJU allows me more flexibility, and I would be able to still take care of my father and get my work done, and so that I can continue being a fellow of this cohort (27) and eventually become an effective teacher. I know this was a long email, thank you in advance for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you. If you would like, you can contact me through this email address (JameciaForsythe@Gmail.com), or by phone 347.255.8446. 

Thank you
Jamecia F.

Jamecia,

At this particular point, the DOE will have to make the decision to allow you back in the program. You do understand that for the summer you must take all courses at the Queens campus.

Hi Mr. Napoli,

My name is Jamecia Forsythe. I was recently admitted to SJU through the NYC Teaching Fellows. However, I put in an appeal hoping that I would be placed in a school in Brooklyn which would help to continue to take care of my father, but I was placed in another school which class schedule would be very hard for me to commit to because I have to take care of my father. I was unaware that within the program, I only had the options of three schools because had I known that, I would have stuck it out with the Queens commute for the summer, and continue in Manhattan for the remainder. I did get in contact with NYCTF representatives, but they say that there is nothing that they can do. I wanted to know if there is still space in your program, so that I can still attend, and if so, would you be able to talk to an NYCTF representative and have me admitted back into SJU because the class scheduling is much more flexible, and I would love to be a part of SJU. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Thank you
Jamecia F.

Her previous application from June 2015 is strong and doesn't say why she wasn't offered a spot in Cohort 26 but I'm assuming it was because her subject area preference (Sped English) was a small cohort.  An NYCTF staff member may want to confirm this (Tabitha?)"

Aaron Hunt is one of our English Fellows from Savannah, Georgia. On June 22 I sent an email alerting you to his homeless situation and his lack of financial resources. Since then Lehman has made available, and will continue to do so, resources to support Aarons success in the summer program. However, we have recently learned that Aaron takes medication for depression and anxiety and, due to financial hardship, has been off medication for an undetermined length of time.

We have referred Aaron to the Lehman Counseling Center and will follow-up with him closely. Dean Fayne asked me to make you aware of this situation such that he can also be monitored at his academy placement.

Best,
Pedro

in the last week
 This has to be the worst administrative support I have ever encountered in my entire life and as a result of the ineptitude of the financial aid department and it's staff, I have been homeless in the two months I have been enrolled at Lehman despite being qualified and approved for over $20,000 worth of federal loans. The problem? You have to pry it out of their evil iron fists first. I can't begin to tell you how depressed and destitute I have been since I was FORCED to go to this school. My program put me at this laughing stock of an educational institute. The only thing I have learned since I've been here is how to survive on the streets. Time is running out and so is what little money I have left... DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL!!!! I cannot emphasize how dangerous it is to be done the way that I have. HEED MY WARNING. I am STUCK and CANNOT leave even if I wanted to. DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL!!!

Subject: Letter of Distress (PLEASE READ)

To those who have the power to make a difference,


My name is Aaron D. Hunt (EMPLID: 23577897). Im a graduate student who recently moved here to participate in the NYC Teaching Fellows program. As a part of the program, I was assigned to Lehman College. Prior to my arrival, I made numerous attempts to secure direct loans from the financial aid department to supplement the cost of school materials (such as books) not covered by the DOE as well as living expensesconsidering the fact that as a born and bred Southerner struggling to keep myself afloat during my undergrad program, the cost of living was considerably cheaper and the wages were meager in comparison. However, since I began the process for securing financial aid for the Summer 2016 semester, I have ran into a considerable degree of obstruction, setbacks from both the NYC Teaching Fellows and Lehman, and ultimately, Lehman itself. While there were administrators who were able to support me marginallyjust enough to keep me sheltered throughout most of the Pre-Service Training part of NYCTF and Summer courses facilitated by Lehmanthe appropriation of financial aid has been delayed so much that now I am in a circumstance where I can no longer provide for myself the most basic human dignities: food, water, and shelter. Because I applied for aid for Summer and Fall of 2016, I was under the impression following several meetings with Mr. Hill, the financial aid director, that I would be provided aid for those semesters pending approval. It hurt me deeply to see that aid was deferred instead to the Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 semestersone of which I never requested, because I knew that I would be in a better economic condition to not have to borrow anything to cover the cost of both course materials and living arrangements. While I have been fortunate enough to be appointed a position as a teacher at Mott Hall V High School for this upcoming school year, it does not mitigate the immediate perils that I face at this time. I am without income for the next two monthsthe rest of August and September, and will not receive my first paycheck as a teacher until October. So it is dispiriting and gravely concerning that in light of the extremes that surround my condition. At this time, I am sleeping on trains (day and night), facing the threat of eviction from a storage facility that I need so desperately so that my stuff isnt all over the place, while having to contend with a dangerous climatic flux. This entire weekend I have endured consecutive days of 100+ degree heat indexes that have caused me to periodically experience the affects of heat exhaustion: I have awakened on trains dizzy with headaches, nausea, sleep deprivation, confusion, dehydration, and without the ability to use the bathroom when I need to. 

This is no way to treat someone who has consistently shown dedication and faith in the institutions that provide him with the opportunities to make beneficial contributions to teaching and the social, emotional, and cognitive development of adolescents in the classroom. I have been waiting so patiently and have been so gracious in spite of the diminutive affects of what support has been given toward mitigating the deplorable condition I have experienced. Please, with all of my substance, I implore of those who have the power to change the outcome of my current situation to please do all that you can now to do what is right and to bestow me the aid that I so desperately fought for specifically for this turbulent time in my lifewhen I need it most. I am hungry now. I am thirsty now. I am tired and sleep deprived now. I am depressed and morally degraded now.Not three weeks from now. Not when everyone gets back from their vacations. I havent had a reprieve from my adversities in over two years. I feel as though these mishaps have been so consistent and so repetitive that it is hard not to feel as though the difficulties Ive experienced have not been deliberate. Please help me. I am running out of time and money. I cannot afford to go two months without a place to sleep, food to eat, and water to drink and I dont deserve any of this considering how hard I workedthe things I have gone through in my life up to this point, graduating with honors, and working hard to earn those better opportunitiesjust to avoid something like this. Please help me. Financial aid is supposed to be approved for the Summer and Fall of 2016. Spring 2017 aid was neither requested nor authorized per the application I submitted. Mishaps like this is what has caused this situation to be prolonged and worsen. Please reach out to me as soon as possible.


Sincerely,

Aaron D. Hunt

My name is Matthew Martin. I was assigned to attend St. John's University. Since I was assigned this university, my schedule has been changed three times by our liaison, Professor Anthony Napoli . Today, I attended my first class only to be told that my name did not appear on the class roll. Professor Napoli arrived at the classroom to tell the instructor that, in fact I WAS registered for this class and that I should remain seated. I stayed for the entire class. However, when I arrived home and was at last able to access the St. John's student site (MyStJohns)--for which we were only given instructions today--I discovered that I was registered for an entirely different class. I am now scrambling to contact my instructors and Professor Napoli to determine what is happening and how to make up my assignments. 

The above situation did not only happen to me. Today during orientation I witnessed SPED Math students being told that they were supposed to attend orientation and classes this morning rather than the afternoon. When they protested that the email schedule they'd received from Professor Napoli read that the time/place to meet indicated they should arrive in the afternoon, he waved away their concerns.

My experience with St. John's thus far has been very stressful. I understand that the Teaching Fellows is limited in what they can do in this situation, however, I am very concerned about my future, and that of my fellow Fellows, at this university going forward. Please be aware that there is a great deal of confusion at St. John's at the moment and I am not confident that it can be rectified.

best, Matthew Martin""",M375_Ashley King,SJU SpEd English Group 1 (Patrice Saunders),,"M375 Mosaic Prep (141 E 111th St, New York, NY 10029) Brian Knobloch",,,M375_Donald Saint-Germain,,Yes,+3.0 and sufficient LA credits,

I was wondering if there was any way my university could be changed. 
I have been completely disatisfied with my Relay experience.  As long as I am in their program, I feel there is no way I would ever be considered an effective educator or receive a satisfactory rating. Since there was no IEP/disabilities/special ed. focus during the summer during fellows' PST, I have been completely unprepared these first weeks of school.  Over the summer I was told my university would be the place to become better prepared for this, but a '2 hour Special Education Welcome Night' ONE time over the summer- where you're given a book and never hear about it again was pointless. I know there is much to learn (especially on the job) as a first year teacher, but Relay has not contributed to any of my knowledge.  I feel the classes are totally useless, as we have spent nearly 2 months on 'teacher identity' aka are you racist or not, rather than things first year teachers - especially Fellows - need to know.  I'd hate for future fellows to have to experience this terrible anxiety I have been dealing with, participating in a """"university"""" program that seems to be a complete joke.   Learning how to wag your finger in a student's face compared to real policies that exist has been a waste of time.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you so much, 
Taylor.""",K136_Vincent Hyland,Relay SpEd Group 1 (Katie Furr),,"K136 Dewey MS (4004 4th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11232) Grant Flatgard",,,K136_Nicole Nevins,,Yes,GPA meets requirement,

Subject: Switching Subject Area : Jarolyn Javier

Hi Erika,

We received a call from Jarolyn Javier (Cohort 27) about changing her subject area. According to our records, her subject area is Bilingual Education 1-6, and she is requesting to switch to Special Education 7-12. Per Jarolyn, she received approval from Hunter to make the switch, and was told that you gave the approval to Hunter, so I wanted to touch base with you to confirm that you have authorized the switch.

Please let me know if I can provide additional information.

Thanks,
Heather

Mohammad was flagged because of a low gpa. After careful review of his application, I would suggest offering him a spot in the program. His statement about his gpa was compelling, and I do think that based on the improvement in subsequent semesters demonstrates his ability to handle the graduate level course work. He has experience with science - a hard to fill subject area and remains committed to serving low income students. His personal experience as a first generation students might help him relate to his students and help them achieve academically and personally.

Jessica's ratings are: Selected-in. 
TP: FA

CA: E
CD: FA+
MIT: E
TSO: FA+

TSPF: FA+
GACT: FA+
TSRT: FA
CTO: FA+

AF: FA
Pro: FA
Comm: FA

I recommend Jessica be selected in with a FA+  in TS and  CT.

Jessica was FA for TP.  Her initial TS TP was confident, succinct, clear, voice audible; however, her TP for the reteach was weak - less eye contact and flat - and thus brought down her overall TP rating. 
Jessica was an E for CA all content is aligned and prioritized.  Her interpretation of objective is correct and examples support mastery (lots of visuals to help build understanding). She was FA+ for CD because she layered content and reviewed area of rectangle before launching into area of triangle; she had some E attributes but checked for understanding only once. She was FA+ for ES because all S had worksheet and some S oral response so most more than one way and all engaged at least once.

Jessica was FA+ for GACT; her intial WTD included all three aspects of WTD, she gave her partner FB that improved their directions, and she applied my coaching.  Jessica was FA for Reteach CT; she included a direction that had some elements of WTD but it was very dense and she did not apply my feedback to break up her WTD direction as we discussed.  

Overall Jessica has no flags and was FA for both competencies of the phone interview, thus I recommend she be accepted into NYCTF."

Hi Meha, 

Thats totally my fault, Im sorry. Way back  in June, I had an informal conversation with Relay about Richardo, and said that if they were comfortable and he was comfortable, we could make the switch. I never heard back about whether it was official, but clearly now it is. My apologies again. His switch is approved. Thanks for letting him know that hes good to go. 

Best,

Subject: C27 Subject Area Change

Hi Charlene and Erika, 
Richardo Smith (Cohort 27 Fellow) came into the office today last week to let us know Relay had changed his subject area from Chemistry Immersion to Biology Immersion. He stated that Relay told him our office approved the switch but I dont see anything in his issue log. Our front office team wouldnt have approved this on their own so was wondering if we had any information from Relay? We told him that we would need to follow up with his university to confirm this information
Thanks!
Meha

I already called him earlier today. He was unaware that he needed to be enrolled in coursework over the summer, so hasnt been attending the two summer sessions at Hunter or taken steps to enroll into Hunter at all. 

We told him that we will follow up with him on next steps, making it aware to him that he needed to be participating in coursework as a component of PST in order to remain in good standing with the program. 

We will need to follow up with Erika on next steps for Johnny.

Best,

This is the email from RelayGSE

Hello, Jing,
 
I hope this email finds you well.
 
Because your undergraduate GPA is below our 2.75 minimum, you are not eligible to enroll in Relay as a matriculated student. Rather, should you receive an offer of admissions, you are only eligible to enroll in Relay as a non-matriculated student. There are significant academic, financial and administrative implications to being a non-matriculated student, considering you will not be earning credit , working towards a degree, nor eligible for certification.  Please read the attached document very carefully as  it summarizes those implications. After reading this document, please let us know if you have any questions. We are happy to help.
 
Best,

In her planning form, Alexandra had all key points aligned to the objective. The form was logically completed. The check for understanding was logical. The teacher and student actions were explained in detail. During her teaching sample, she was confident and maintained eye contact with the class. Her tone and volume were appropriate. She was consistently facing the class. She also had very good economy of language. Although she wasn't necessarily engaging, she did meet most of the indicators for an FA+ in teacher presence. She interpreted the objective correctly and spent most of her time on material important to the objective. Her content was accurate. Her lesson materials were in service to the objective. The lesson objective was clear to students because it was explicitly stated at the beginning and ending of the lesson. She used a model to convey information. Also, during her check for understanding she asked students to explain why their answers were correct. She engaged all students at least once, and most students had more that one way to engage in the lesson. She used student volunteers and choral responses to engage students. The lesson pace was steady, and much of the lesson time was spent on the most important activities related to the objective. During the group activity, she gives observable and concrete directions. She she implemented my feedback. Her feedback was focused on economy of language. She did give several WTD directions during her initial teaching sample, so I feel she has a clear understanding of WTD. During the re-teach, she gave concrete and observable directions. Her directions led students to complete an academic task. Overall, I would recommend Alexandra for the NYCTF program."

Samantha's TSPF was well organized, and provided strong details. She had a strong TP showing confidence for most of the lesson, and only sounding nervous in the beginning. Strong voice and maintained eye contact with the class most of the time, only looking at notes a few times. Spoke succinctly, and clear. For CD, candidate used a model, and the lesson objective was clear to students. Candidate used a CFU that aligned with mastery of the objective. Candidates biggest strength was in SE. She engaged all participants at least once, and provided all participants to participate, and two ways to engage students (Cold Calling, asking and answering questions, Turn and talk with partners, and students share examples at the end). Due to her strong TS, and overall performance during the selection event, I would recommend her.
