""How do you define academic success for students in high-need schools and communities?""
""To what extent do you believe these strategies will be successful?""

HE1: FA
Speaks positively about students' ability to be academically successful. ""I wholeheartedly believe that every person has the potential to be greater than where are...""

Definition of academic success success is vague or incomplete.

HE 2: FA-
Offers teacher-driven strategies in their response to Part 3 questions 1 and 2 but is uncertain if external challenges that impact achievement can be overcome. 
 ""I wholeheartedly believe that every person has the potential to be greater than where are, but they have to want it badly enough.""

HE 3: FA
Generally positive attitude towards working high-need schools and communities, but does not specifically state desire to work in high-need communities.
-""I don’t have experience working with low income or special needs populations, but I do have experience working in the real world and understand what it takes to be successful. That’s what I hope to impart on my students, and to help guide them on how each of them can be successful in whichever field they choose to focus on regardless of where they started.""

HE 4: FA
Candidate provides strategies that show caring and concern for student well-being and achievement.
""...what I can do is try and set up a meeting with the student before class to find out how I can adapt my teaching to help her feel more inspired enough to pay attention.""
However, tone is slightly negative when the candidate says, ""If she still doesn't care..."" (We can't assume that the student doesn't care, it could be another problem).

Candidate jumps from idea to idea at times. For instance:
""I find that it also helps for students to teach each other. During labs, the students were split into groups of 2 or 3 and they were able to combine their knowledge to work the material out. During my time in Belize, we spent time educating the locals on the importance of deworming the stray animal population. Although they live in poverty and a majority of them didn’t attend school, they understood the dangers of allowing the animals to get infected with parasites that can be transmitted to humans. Using different methods to ensure that all students’ understand the material is essential in ensuring high academic success.""

HE 1 - FA
Speaks positively about students; ability to be academically successful. Does not directly discuss student academic standards or expectations.

HE 2 - FA+
Demonstrates confidence and optimism in ability to overcome challenges. For example: ""I think these strategies will be very successful. As a student, I started out in similar fashion. I didn’t realize that how intelligent and motivated about school I could be until a teacher showed interest in my success.""

HE 3 - FA
Generally positive attitude towards working in high-needs schools and communities, but does not specifically state desire to work in high-needs communities.
Ex: Part 1, question 1.

HE 4 - FA+
Candidate provides strategies that show caring and concern for student well-being and achievement.
""The first step I would take is to speak to her other teachers to get a sense if this happening in other classes or just in mine. The next step I would take is to talk to the student regarding her disengagement during class to get a sense of what she is thinking and what advice I could offer. I’d also contact the parent so we could come up with a plan.

1: Does not address directly how students' socio economic status affects their potential for success (the candidate does mention factors that can affect the students school day or how much they like school, but does not directly address the potential for academic success, as the question asks). In the last question does not address to what extent the strategies will be successful.
2: there is a lot of recycled content in the candidate's answers. most of the time it is relevant to the question, but on one occasion it is not.

1: definition of academic success is vague or incomplete ""Academic success is defined differently depending on the student.

E.g. Part 1 Question 2, she lists multiple job experiences better suited for a resume (and not related to teaching, although related to preferred subject area)

HE: This was difficult to relate, as applicant has a variety answers. Generally positive, but not very specific regarding the definition of success, or at least the definition is hard to determine. Some positive examples ->
“I will make an effort to spend time with them individually to make sure they understand the lesson.” HE2 FA+
“Be patient, understanding, and listening to them.” HE4 – FA+ evidence
“Call the attention of the students and have an open discussion of what causes her low academic performance.” HE4 – FA evidence
Also, does not really address high needs communities specifically. Unclear if the applicant is aware of what this means. “Defining academic success for students in high need school and communities- means spending more time and assisting homework, higher score in examination, and the ability of going to college.”

Pro: The style, format, and grammar throughout answer section was not common, and made it quite difficult to understand the points the applicant was trying to make. Resume etc was fine, although I did not note any mention of teaching, including on the resume.

Notes: This was difficult to score! Right on the edge of rec w/ res and screen out. In general, I did not get the sense that this candidate is passionate about teaching, answers were too general and all over the place to really gauge fairly. Follow up may provide clarity. However, scoring pushed to screen out.

- ""New York City is extremely diverse and students are immediately introduced to intercultural communication. What is more important than helping the youth grow up to be respected individuals? The youth need to know that education is the way to succeed. The statistics on minority and low-income students and its correlation with academic success is heart breaking and as a teacher I know I will make a difference... I want to make a lasting impact and positive influence in children’s lives.""

- ""In high-need schools it is difficult to achieve this goal and you may need to switch your teaching style to cater to your students. Socio-economic status can affect a student because they may lack resources to assist with learning. Students may also have working parents and family members that cannot assist them with school matters at home. Family background includes some guardians being immigrants, which creates a language barrier. Also, they may not place importance on their child’s education... Many students face these obstacles but that does not mean that they can’t be successful and thrive in the classroom and in their lives.""
- ""I am confident that I can ensure high academic achievement for all students I will teach because every student is a priority. I need to make sure every student fully understands the work and are on track... Aside from these socioeconomic differences, I must also take into account the different behavioral and physical needs of each child. Communication with the kids I worked with was important in creating a safe and helpful environment. My communication skills may be the one aspect that will improve student outcomes. Building and creating a specific environment and approach for each child will inevitably allow me to focus on each child’s needs.""

I’m good at building relationships because I think they are the core for anything that comes after that.

- ""The factors mentioned above profoundly impact a student’s potential academic stance/success. It’s possible if a student comes from a low socio economic family they may have a parent(s) who work many hours to make ends meet. Then you have children who need help at home but can’t get it. Students could have a family background where education isn’t exceptionally important or forced which parallels to how the student may interpret their own education. If the student had negative experiences in their previous school, they may still carry that baggage around which could affect how they behave in class, responses to teachers and their self-esteem. They may hate school because of whatever those previous experiences were. Considering this, my definition of academic success is a student who shows up physically and mentally in class and puts forth an effort to have an open mind about learning and tries hard every day.""
- ""I believe I would be successful in ensuring high academic achievement for my students because I would hold them high expectations and encourage them to do the same for themselves. Considering my Social Work background, I look at all factors when it comes to a student’s learning and I‘ve had significant experience with special needs/low income populations. I find that you have to acknowledge their circumstance. It may be difficult yet it doesn’t define their academic journey, they do that.""
- ""The first thing I would do is failure, have a sit down conversation with this student coming from a compassionate place instead of a confrontational place.

2: relevant answers
3: 
Most answers are clear and direct but in part 2 question 1, she starts by talking about her personal experiences before more directly addressing the question ""As a pre-teen, moving from New York to Florida was a difficult transition. Especially going to class in trailers and having to be surrounded in an environment with minimal disciplinary action."" I believe she was using this personal experience as an example of how students from different backgrounds may struggle, resulting in challenges in school but the paragraph was not well organized and this connection was not immediately clear. 
Once instance where a possible mispelling or incorrect word use leads to confusion. ""Previous mal experiences can"" -- not sure if she means to say bad or another word.


HE
1: Defines success for students from at-risk schools, and feels it looks different for different students. She never states whether or not she thinks all students have the potential to for academic achievement. ""Academic success in neglected schools is the on-going effort of promoting academic excellence and overall growth as an autonomous moral individual; ultimately leading to a successful, independent lifestyle as an adult."" ""I've come to realize that academic success is tailored to each student in different ways""
2: In one answer takes responsibility for student achievement and expresses confidence in her ability to get the students to achieve""I believe that my background in Psychology and previous work experience is a great foundation for special needs students in achieving academic success. I can monitor progress and tailor lesson plans to each student by accommodating to their needs. ""
In another answer wants to push work onto other parties and expresses doubt that obstacles can be overcome without parents putting in their part ""Attempt to work with the student and the parent/legal guardian. However, this may not always work, in low-income neighborhoods most of the time the parents/legal guardians are working or often do not have the “time” to put in the extra effort. Depending on the situation, I would forward the information on to a representative from a third party. It will most likely be the best point of contact because they can observe the situation at hand from an unbiased angle and make the best informed decision for the student.""
3: Desire to work in high needs community ""I want to decrease the gap that is most prevalent among minorities by moving change in the most diverse city of our nation, New York City.... I wish to put forth my work for students that need them the most, students with special needs in communities that are deprived of the education they rightfully deserve. ""
4: strategies are neutral (tell the students about the long term effects of falling behind and give her some strategies, working with the student and guardians, refer her to a professional who can make ""the best informed decision for the student""

Pro
1: misspellings? ""From my daily observation's"" ""The approach that I have taken put's '
mispelling ""Specifically call attention to the issue at hand in and understanding manner""
many minor errors (particularly fragments) and some unusual word choice that do not constitute major errors ""the experiences gained upon the way have enabled me to view the world with an enhanced set of lenses. ""
2: Mostly the application is polished and follows directions but under the question about ambiguities in resume she just provides additional information about work experience she has had, rather than addressing ambiguities
3: one employment gap, right after college, otherwise, consistent employment. 
4: GPA statement takes responsibility and shows confidence in future performance, also her undergrad GPA is over 3.0, it's just the associates program that has a lower GPA. She is a first generation colleges student but otherwise no evidence of positive performance. 


Check Pro 1 -- I am aware that a mistake in apostrophe use is normally considered a minor error (for example students' versus student's) but these words are not possessive nouns or contractions leading me to think it was not a misunderstanding of proper use of apostrophe but a typo that was never corrected and may be categorized as a misspelling rather than apostrophe use error. There was also another error that I listed in CT 1 that perhaps could be listed as a misspelling but I listed it in CT 1 because I wasn't sure what the candidate was trying to say.

2: tangent in part 1 question 2 ""With that said I also believe that best teachers continue to grow regardless of their academic achievement or professional hours earned. ""
tangent in part 2 question 3 ""I think that the greatest reason for low performance level in high-need schools is critically low expectations set by the teachers. Something makes teachers believe that low-income high-need communities do not need much education and high expectations when, in fact, they are the ones needed to be heard and thoroughly directed into the right path.""
3: Answers are direct and clear

HE
1: states belief in all students but definition of academic success is vague ""my belief is that every student is capable but they would not know it unless I, the teacher, show it to them. ""
2: states that students are bound to fall behind in some areas and while providing some teacher driven strategies, puts more responsibility on the school to provide extra resources"" I will ensure that the curriculum is challenging enough and includes plenty of small quizzes and extra point work and the standards set are appropriate for given group of students. However, there will be students falling behind one class but perform highly in another. For that matter the school should be willing and able to provide afterschool or weekend programs for each given subject because everybody deserves a chance.""

1: Does not seem to understand part 2 question 1. Addresses how a students background might affect how they learn best and discusses a teachers obligation to respond to that, but does not clearly define success or discuss how a students background effects potential for success. 
Did not answer part of part 2 question 2 (do you believe you will be successful?)
2: answers are relevant
3: answers are clear and direct

HE
1: Does not address beliefs about students' ability to be achieve other than to say ""we are well aware that all students learn at different paces""
2: ""By changing my teaching method and by providing extra help in the problem area I believe academic success can be achieved."" ""We as educators have to be able to cater to all learning styles.""
3: Demonstrates desire and passion for working in low income community ""I am also very aware of how it feels to be from a low income family and considered an ""at risk"" student myself. That being said I know what some of these children are going through and can connect with them coming from the same situations.

Again in the second question of part 3, the candidate does not address to what extent her strategies will be successful. 
The candidate's responses are not all relevant. There is a long tangent about thirst for learning in part1 question 2. In part 2 question 2 speaks extensively about her family's schedule growing up and how she developed a love for reading but does not relate it back to the central point (how it will help her improve student outcomes)
HE- High expectations for all students ""whether the student has no money or is a millionaire is of no matter.""
role of the teacher is vague compared to other constituents ""The academic success of any student is determined by first and foremost the student, followed by the parent (the child's 1st teacher) and the student's school teachers.""Also talks about going to other teachers to make a plan for the student's success. The candidate states she is confident she can raise student achievement in her subject area but makes no claims to being successful with all students and does not express confidence that her strategies will work (in fact, fails to answer that part of the question at all). Has positive attitude toward low income communities but does not explicitly say she wants to work in one. Shows concern for student well being, taking time to ask the student what is going on, developing trust, and collaborating with other teachers to create a plan specifically for the student.

several tangents: question 1 part 1 ""I want people to be thankful for every, second, minute, and hour that they are here on God's green earth."", question 2 part 1 ""NYC is a big melting pot. We know this. Also, it is a known fact there are people from many different income levels and backgrounds."", 
One unclear sentence where it is hard to discern point: For those who come from a lower income family or a high need community or school, I feel that the socio-economic status of a student and their potential for academic success will coincide with the simple fact that in order to succeed at a higher level, the student merely has to escape this situation. Question 2 part 2"" 
""This is what life is about. Improving daily, learning new things everyday, and truly enjoying life to its fullest. ""


HE- The candidates language is very unclear but I think she is saying she has high expectations for all students ""For those who come from a lower income family or a high need community or school, I feel that the socio-economic status of a student and their potential for academic success will coincide with the simple fact that in order to succeed at a higher level, the student merely has to escape this situation. This is done by achieving good grades, finding better jobs and scoring high levels on college exams. If the student can escape this situation by thriving, they can help bring their family out as well and no one said this would be an easy task but it can and must be done. The families must support these students until the student can do the same for their families.""
Candidate is optimistic about ability to raise achievement but teacher's role is minor compared to others (talks about bringing in parents and guidance counselors. ""I would address the student's low academic performance by getting in contact with the student's parents. I feel that they have to know what the student is doing. I think if it got to this point it would be imperative. By getting the parents involved, I would hope to see a change in the student's behavior in my class. Another thing that I would do to address the student's academic performance would be to send the student to the guidance counselor or school psychologist.....Maybe the student does not want to talk to me, so hopefully one of these professionals could assist in getting things done.""
Generally positive about working in low income community but does not explicitly state it. 
Candidates strategies demonstrate lack of care (sending student to guidance counselor and calling parents rather than working with the students), implication that the student is at fault and the student just needs to change behavior.""Hopefully these strategies would be very successful in working because they put a large impetus on the student to change their attitude and behavior.""

Defines success differently for students of different backgrounds while maintaining high standards for all. ""The metric for academic success is significantly different in underserved communities. When students start at lower academic levels and don’t have access to as many resources, the expectations of the students and definitions of “success” are vastly below par. In order to guarantee academic success for students from diverse backgrounds, a teacher must set expectations that are both challenging and attainable and assist students in meeting these expectations with extra tutoring and regular conversations. Only once the student has successfully reached these expectations can the teacher raise the standards and push students to achieve even more. Academic success in high-need schools can therefore be defined as consistently raising the expectations and encouraging students to reach for attainable goals.""

“Sometimes, a student just needs that push to do their best and I will bring out the best of the student. I will be successful because no matter how deviant a student is deep down they want to be a good student and be successful.”

Success vaguely defined, somewhat differently for HN community (subtle)
“I define academic success for students in high-need schools and communities achieving the unexpected and exceeding societal limitation placed on them”

HE2 FA
Takes responsibility for students’ success
“As a teacher, I will force the student to confront these pressures and help them to find the will to use all their intellectual, creative and inspirational strength of overcome these pressures.”

Approaches somewhat teacher driven, but mostly refers to others (see Part 3 Question 2)

“I am able to show students from low-income that I relate to them and can help them.”

As such, I would define success for any student as active engagement, interest, and motivation toward achievement and career readiness

As for family background I feel that the more student comes from a more successful background tend to be more successful in school and have higher potential for success in their educational endeavors


HE - POS
One way I will ensure this is by getting to know my students, their background, and their interests. From there, I will design my lessons in a way that will appeal to them, hold high expectations for everyone, and make sure my lessons are accessible to each individual need

One way to reach the student would be to modify the lesson in a way she can understand it. Students learn in all different ways, and it would be my job to figure out which method is best for her.

I know that students of all backgrounds and capabilities are capable of amazing achievements

- academic success different for different students ""One must look at the small achievements that the students make. Motivating a student who rarely does homework to do the work, helping a 4th grader who is at a kindergarten reading level to tap out words, and helping an English language learner to say sentences with understanding are achievements.""
- ""I feel that all children should receive the education they deserve no matter what their abilities or disabilities may be. I feel that all students should be given the opportunity to reach their full potential.""
- "" I believe that helping students achieve their goals and exceeding their goals will raise academic achievement in special ed. Raising academic success in a subject area could just mean using extra manipulatives in math or modifying the reading assignment while having the student still work on the skills that are necessary for the State tests. These modifications may also be necessary in a general ed classroom. It is important for all students to know that some students learn differently and we should all have the material necessary to be successful.""
- can these be overcome? ""A student's socio-economic status can have a negative impact on academic success. For example, a student who comes to school tired every day. Upon speaking to the student, you learn they have bedbugs that are keeping them up because they are making the child itchy. A student's family background can have an impact on their success because they may not have any help at home with homework due to lack of knowledge or language. A student in high school may have to work after school to help out with expenses at home, not allowing enough time for studying or homework. Previous experience with schooling can impact a student's academic success based on whether or not their experience was positive or negative.""
- ""I believe I will be successful in ensuring high academic achievement for all students I will teach because I have the patience and understanding to communicate with students to ensure their needs are being met. I work in a Title I school and also live within the same community in which the school is located. The students come from various ethnic backgrounds and their economic status varies greatly... Students from low income families may be in need of extra supplies. I would make sure they have all the supplies they need for a successful school year. I would do this in a way as to not embarrass the student. I want my students to feel safe in my classroom.""

""Achievement in this context [low income communities] is measured by the level of participation I seek to inspire. Measured thusly, achievement is not unmoored from conventional measures of performance; increased test scores can be facilitated through engagement and engrossment with the material at hand in a positive classroom culture.

uncertain if external challenges can be overcome  by teaching """"While my first inclination is to convey a resounding affirmation of my ability to ensure across the board high achievement, I think that such a proclamation would be misguided and foolish. Even at the most prestigious high schools low marks are earned and students are not retained. Indeed, focusing on unilateral high achievement seems misguided and an unworthy goal. Instead, I can affirm that I will seek to show ALL students that improvement can be made through hard-work, that engaging with new material can be challenging but also illuminating, that they are capable of success through commitment, that failure in the classroom is an opportunity for improvement and not a mark of personal inadequacy, and that I will always be there for them.

- doesn't define academic success
- ""Students growing up in low income families may affect their potential to strive in either a positive or negative way... If negative, the students may not have the potential to succeed because of limited resources the guardian can provide. Maybe the student has to babysit his or her younger siblings, which forces them to become independent before their time. This will affect their abilities to do their homework and follow directions in school. Because of their independence at home, without their guardian present at home, it allows them to make their own rules and regulations which might become a problem at school.""

While volunteering for the elementary school, Math was one of the many subjects I've assisted students with. I showed them the techniques I've learned to tackle the problems as well as the teacher's technique. I made them understand the problems by relating them to real life situations. Once the students understood the lesson and techniques, it immediately made them eager to solve it on their own without any help. Those who still needed help, I walked through the lesson with them once more or for however much times they needed me too.""

Speaks positively about students’ ability to be academically successful, but definition of academic success is vague or incomplete.
“Academic success is not defined differently for students in high-need schools but the impact of home life and economic status definitely has an impact on students. I have worked with students who have absolutely no interest in learning or making friends simply because their parents are in the middle of a divorce and they sleep in a different bed every other night. I have taught students who were bullies because they didn't think they could make friends based on a negative past experience. The circumstances greatly affect the attitudes of students but the success of a student is not based on what community they live in but what they individually overcome to do well or just better in school.”

“First, I would find out why she was falling behind. Is she a visual learner and I have been lecturing too often? Does she have some sort of learning disorder or physical problem such as needing glasses? Was there a teacher in the past that she accelerated academically with, what about that teachers style worked for her? I would exhaust questions like this and if I still could not find an answer I would find out which subject she was doing the best in and add more into my lesson plans and praise her in class to help gain some confidence. I would suggest tutoring to parents and hopefully she would ask for extra help from me or study harder at home now that she felt that she had the potential to do well.”

HE 1- FA
Speaks positively about student’s ability to be academically successful. Definition of academic success is vague. 
“A student does not limit their academic potential if they are affected negatively by previous experiences. A student can strive to their full potential once they learn to adapt their skill set in a new way, based on their previous experiences.”

“I define academic success for students in high-need schools and communities outside of the prescriptive norms of letter or numbers. Academic success is bred from student’s tenacity to engage with subject matter, not just retain information. I believe a student is academically successful if they contextualize their classroom experience in other environments.”

HE 2 – FA+
Demonstrates confidence and optimism in ability to overcome challenges.
“I believe my strategies will be successful because they are unique approaches to academics that can strengthen confidence, and approach learning in new ways.”

“I will be able to raise academic achievements by demonstrating my own passion for English as a holistic subject matter. It is my ability to think both intellectually and creatively that allowed me to strive in alternative subject matter, and I would hope to implement similar pedagogical approaches within my students.”

HE 3: FA+
Candidate demonstrates both desire and passion to work in high needs school.
“Working with the chlidren after school allowed me to experience first hand the inequities within elementary and secondary school's in New York. The children at P.S. 145 inspired me to pursue a career with higher-risk schools because of their personal socio-economic plights, and how this affected their learning capabilities. Regardless socio-economic circumstances, each child has the right to an equal and advanced education.”

HE 4: FA+
Candidate provides strategies that show caring and concern for student well-being and achievement.
“The first would be to speak with her in a neutral setting, and ask leading questions, such as who her friends are at school, and what her dream class would be like? By asking questions that allow her to tell me more about her without appearing probing, it would give her an opportunity if she chooses to speak freely. Depending on her answers, I would be able to contextualize factors that may be influencing her distressing behavior. The second step would be to create a custom activity that she could engage with (such as interactive or creative) to gage her strengths and weaknesses in reading, writing, and math.”

Uses generalizations instead of directly addressing the questions
HE: ""Can all sttudents learn-an avid YES. A positively memorable teacher is not placed in a position to teach, but instead placed in a setting to know his/her curriculum and relay the standard curriculum in the best way for his/her student population to absorb and exercise the information, as I will seek to do.""
Unclear if she thinks she will be successful or if she is just referring to best practices: ""In being successful to ensuring academic achievement for any students a positive teacher will take into consideration his/her demographic, and adapt the curriculum to engage students think/learning style accordingly. In modifying the coursework there will be a show of concern, and respect for their learning abilities. As such I learn from my student as they will provide input creating interactive learning. Interactive learning is fosters an innovative learning environment because the students are learning me and vice versa as well as themselves.""
Unclear definition of academic success: ""Academic success is based on the child; achieving at one’s highest intellectual level. For my students the chance to start their endeavor to their greatest level will start in my classroom. This journey will be garnered through a plan and communication.""

-""What action steps would you take to determine these causes?"" (only one action step listed)

CT 2- No.
Response does not link back to the questions asked.
-Part 2 - ""For example, if it were up to me uniform would be a requirement, so the children can focus less on the material aspects of life while in school. Being impoverished or in less fortunate situations can be obvious and the child may be subjected to bullying, teasing and embarrassment. When some children have expensive or the ""latest style"" clothing and others haven't changed their clothing for the most part of the year, they can feel insecure. Some may even tend desperately fit in, that they result in doing something unlawful. I believe trying to decrease or even eliminate the focus of these issues can allow the students to concentrate on their work so they can reach all academic achievements.""

CT 3 - No.
Candidate jumps from idea to idea at times. For example:
""Many times depending on these circumstances it can determine the way the student will perform. Due to some cultural beliefs, though a family may be financially burdened, they believe a child should still succeed academically. Having prior knowledge of the influences of family background, and socio-economics helps me to understand the impact these different aspects may have on an individual and his or her academic success.""

Secondly, as part of the improvement plan, I would advise and assign a tutor to that particular student that would work with the student both during and outside of class.

HE 1- FA-
Is uncertain about all students being able to achieve.
“I think it would be unrealistic to expect 100% success in high academic achievement with each student that I teach, but I absolutely would do everything in my power to help students achieve to their highest academic ability. Student achievement especially in low income and special needs populations is often distorted because their abilities are applied to a normal learning curve without taking into account real-life situations that could affect their performance. There are so many factors to consider other than my ability to teach and empathize with student needs (as mentioned in the previous question, socio-economic status, family background, previous schooling experience, etc.) that would likely effect high academic achievement. With that said, I do not think that it is impossible, just quite a high expectation.”

HE 2 - FA+
Demonstrates confidence and optimism in ability to overcome challenges.
“I am confident that I can identify strengths and weaknesses in others and help them achieve to the best of their abilities, often beyond what they believe they can. One of my most difficult clients I began working with when he was 3 years old. He is now 7 and is completing second grade at BASIS elementary school. This child has struggled with behavioral issues throughout his childhood, displaying internal and external stresses throughout the years that I have worked with him. He used to hit himself in the head, throw tantrums, talk viciously to authority figures, and act out both at home and in the classroom. Over time using positive reinforcement, talk therapy, and meaningful undivided attention his behaviors have significantly improved and he is no longer causing havoc for himself and others every day. Also having worked with adult populations, helping them find a place in their communities, I am confident that I can also help students find their place in their world and among their peers.”

HE 3: FA+
Candidate demonstrates both desire and passion to work in high needs school.
“I would prefer to teach Special Education as I feel it is sometimes hardest for these individuals to feel that they have a voice, and I have felt most fulfilled working with this population in the past.”

HE 4: FA+
Candidate provides strategies that show caring and concern for student well-being and achievement.
“I would initially talk to the student and try to better understand where she is coming from and what potential struggles she could be having. If she is struggling with reading and understanding what is asked of her I would offer time after school (if feasible) or I would establish sessions with tutors or academic aids within or outside of the school.”

The student may also have no interest in schoolwork because of the various distractions, such as her iPod. If the distractions can be eliminated with the help of the mother, the problem may be resolved. Another likely cause for the off task behavior for this student may be that she has still not mentally fit in the school. She may feel reluctant to ask for help but parent and teacher intervention can help the student to focus on the schoolwork.""
- ""The first strategy is to increase the student’s reading and mathematics performance through one-on-one tutoring sessions.

“My experience with these gives me confidence as I embrace the role I am holding: I’ve been the formal and informal learner; I’ve been the facilitator;”
“Students’ participation in the class greatly improved in Sunday school after I allowed them to eat in the classroom after I learned that the church provides them food to supplement their food needs.”

HE: 

HE1 FA

Contradictory/unclear definition of success
“Before defining academic success for students in high-need schools and communities it is crucial to create equity for the learner, because various factors define success, not merely high grades. Success should be tied to college entrance as well as career achievements.”

Unusual example for Part 3 Question 1 seems to indicate different expectations, but hard to tell. Needs follow up

HE2 FA

Very confident, but doesn’t always take responsibility for student’s success
“Teaching, coaching, tutoring comes naturally to me with experience engaging with people of diverse cultures, backgrounds and ages.”

Desire to teach is clear
“Every student passing is a pass for teacher and I love working hard to ensure learners are progressing until they are collectively learning and improved in assessments”

HE3 FA
Equity in education addressed directly, but I didn’t see a personal desire to work with high needs communities specifically
“As a journalist I’ve championed leveling the playing fields in other sectors; equity is a great tool for ending poverty, ensures students are given a chance to achieve college and career success.”


HE4 FA-
Individualized learning
“This one on one tutorial session times is critical in the pupil-teacher relations.”

Singling out student, offers
“When one student refused to participate in the assessment exercise, I ignored her by skipping her when asking questions around the room.”


PRO: Resume a bit difficult to read, and not tailored to program, but generally ok. Many achievements listed.

""Academic success occurs when students work hard and strive to reach their personal potential through class participation, being an engaged listener, and studying hard.

But, I’m certain that all students can be high achieving if they have understanding teachers to guide and inspire them.""
""Children need good role models to show them a good example of how to behave. They need adults to reinforce that their talents are meaningful, and their dreams are achievable.

Shows student-driven strategies: ""Many times students in high needs schools have no positive affirmation at home and a teacher sometimes is the only source of encouragement and support.

HE 1: FA
Candidate speaks positively about students’ ability to be academically successful, but definition of academic success is vague or incomplete.
""Special need doesn't eliminated the possibilities of finding other ways to help the student learn.""

HE 2: FA+
Demonstrates confidence and optimism in ability to overcome challenges.
“No doubt in my mind that I will make a huge impact on the students' academic achievement .”
“I have proven this true when I was Professional tutor at Nyack College. I have helped more than 500 students pass their class with an A.”
“I don't doubt of my competencies to make my students academically successful.”

HE 3: FA
Candidate demonstrates both desire and passion to work in high needs school.
“I was poor at young age. Very poor that my mother had to feed us with tree leaves. I want to make a change. I believe in The United States, we have more than enough to alleviate poverty through education.”
However, word choice/tone is slightly disrespectful in the following statement:
""It is just a temporary inconvenience and there is always a solution to that.""

HE 4: FA+
Candidate provides strategies that show caring and concern for student well-being and achievement.
“If it appear that the student low academic performance is due to previous non mastery of concepts, I can provide help after class to help the student master the concepts.”

Jumps around from idea to idea at times.

HE 1: FA
Speaks positively about students’ ability to be academically successful, but definition of academic success is vague or incomplete.

HE 2: FA+ 
Demonstrates confidence and optimism in ability to overcome challenges.
“After implementing all these strategies, I definitely think that this student will come around and participate during class lesson. She will build her confident enough to get involve and succeed.”

“Personally I will take any situation and make the best out of it.”

HE 3: FA+
Candidate demonstrates both desire and passion to work in high needs school. 
“Having the privilege to be a teacher in New York City would give me an opportunity to give back to the community and possibly change the future students of today; for they are our future leaders of tomorrow.”

“Having the opportunity to teach Math to our youth will enable me to help our struggling students in this area”

HE 4: FA+
Candidate provides strategies that show caring and concern for student well-being.
“First, I would pull her aside and have a one-one talk where if needed I could help her. Also, I would find ways to ensure that the classroom environment is more engaging and fun to attract her attention and others. In addition, another primary cause for student’s off-task behavior is because the teacher's lesson was poorly planned or presented in a disorganized manner. To effectively determine these causes, I will monitor her daily progress and work closer with her in terms of simplify home works or assignments to equip her with better understanding of the subject. I will offer more off classroom tutoring or coaching time needed to determine what ways to better teach her so she is not off task while in class.”

“I will ensure that the lesson content is appropriately matched to her abilities by breaking new material into small, manageable increments, or steps. Secondly, I will make her feel comfortable talking and asking questions to me as much and she needs to and can come to me to talk about anything. I will focus on making my instruction orderly, predictable, and highly motivating find which can generally hold the attention of students most of the time. It is also important to remember factors in the classroom setting and that her level of attention is at least partly determined by the learning environment. Finally, I will provide timely and regular performance feedback and corrections throughout the lesson as needed to guide student learning.”

HE (one FA-)
-whether or not students from LIC's should be held to lower academic standards is contradictory - see two quotes  below:

I define academic success for students in high-need schools and communities as somewhat unique to the individual student. I do not believe there is one universal marker of success - for one student, it may be getting into a particular college, while for another, it may be becoming so skilled in math that he or she is able to take a greater role in running a family business. I imagine this to be true in any school in which students have their own unique goals in life, but especially so in high-need schools in which outside challenges may affect day-to-day classroom performance.

While this does not mean that they should be held to lower standards, it means that they may not always know what they are capable of achieving themselves.

However, the scales should match in some regard. For me academic success for them would be attending class everyday, attentiveness and gradual improvement .""
Often states confidence about raising student achievement and gives teacher driven strategies ""Without a doubt I'd ensure high academic achievement for all my students...For them I'd modify my lesson plans so those children don't get lost or hold an hour of ""free time"" where students can seek me out for additional help. If certain students are truly struggling I'd encourage them not to give up and offer to tutor them.""
Also expresses uncertainty to overcome challenges with a focus on external factors ""I think my second strategy would prove more successful because it'd be easier to provide extra help in the subject and get her motivated than resolving her family problems. In that department the most I could do initially would be to get her parents to agree to a meeting. If they refuse I'd get nowhere with my student."" 
Seems neutral about working in a low income community. 
strategies show care-- mentions talking to the student and letting her know she cares.

for CT2: answers are tangential and don't always link back to prompt; see part 1/question 2 for example: ""There were times in my career history that I was not paid for six months, but I was not agitated by that because my real aim was about the academic success of my students (in answer to the question, ""Do you believe you will be successful?"")  

HE1- FA: generally positive about student achievement, but doesn't define academic success; experience with WAEC exams suggest rigorous standards 

HE2- FA+: takes responsibility for student success: ""academic success in this low-income community depends on the commitment of teachers""; shares teacher-driven strategies: ""after school enrichment program to improve the performance of students"" AND lessons are prepared with student engagement in mind

HE3- FA: candidate is committed to equality: ""I am a person who advocates for equality among kids, irrespective of their race, tribe, sex and their religious background""; BUT comments about equality don't link to equal access to quality education; passionate about urban education but less explicit about HN schools 

HE4- FA: strategies are neutral (strategies aren't individualized; strategies are directed to all low performers)

Teaching inner-city youth the art of communication and literacy is something that will have a huge impact on their academic success. Being confident and having a strong command of the English language is a great way to get youth to a college ready academic level.""
HE: Believes he will be successful: ""I believe I will be successful in raising the academic achievements of these students because I was once in their shoes. I grew up in the inner-city and understand the struggles that come along with it. I am aware that often times outside factors have a great impact on the academic performance of students and their motivation for school in all.""
Unclear definition of academic success: ""Academic success to me is being prepared and motivated to continue your education, especially in a high-needs school. Often times in the inner-city it is easy for a youth to derail from the path of education given some of the issues that take place in underprivileged communities.""
""Learning how to still hold yourself to a high academic standard regardless of how many outside factors get in your way is crucial when it comes to the academic success of a student.""
Doesn't really address if he will be successful: ""Helping students adjust to changes in their life is a good way to get them comfortable in a classroom setting, and focused on the material so that they reach their full academic potential. It will be a gradual process, but I will always hold each student to a high academic standard.""
Whole-class strategies: "" I would have students engage in free-writes in order to give them the platform to express their interests. This type of writing can also give me insight into some outside factors that may be having an impact on their behavior in the classroom.""

""I would first speak to the child directly and ask her if she believes the work is to hard. Building a relationship with the child will assist her with opening up and what may be holding her back from her studies.""
-""One method would be to spend more time with the student and keep her updated on work, as well as asking her if she has any questions regarding any assignments. That be a good method to evaluate her progress as well as give her the opportunity to ask questions if needed. Since I am giving the student more attention she may feel comfortable asking for assistance if she was not before. Sometimes when students are not confident in themselves they refrain from asking questions. If this method does not produce effective results I may adjust the student handouts and provide more examples so she may then grasp the concepts easier.

2: candidate is mostly confident in ability to overcome challenges and offers some teacher driven strategies but feels external constituents also need to play a role, but the role of the teacher is still primary ""I believe that I can be successful in ensuring high academic achievement for all students from low-income communities. However, academic achievement is only possible through an integrated effort of families, students, faculty, school, and the school district. High academic achievement would require the effort of everyone pushing to meet clear goals and objectives. In some instances this would require social workers, psychologists, and counselors. In other situations it would require academic support. Obviously, high academic achievement can only be attained by a comprehensive effort but starts with the teacher’s preparation, effort, motivation, and teaching style. ""
3: states explicit desire to work with diverse NY students, has worked with underprivileged populations before.
4: some strategies show caring -- will talk to the student and engage with different learning tools, try to provide a safe environment but most of the strategies are not individualized and are directed at either the whole class or all low performers.

Demonstrates confidence and optimism in ability to overcome challenges.
“I think my patience, intuition and love of learning will help me in being successful in the academic achievement of my students.”

“Whenever my students have an issue grasping a concept from the lesson I will do whatever is in my power to find a solution.”

Candidate demonstrates both desire and passion to work in high needs school. 
“Another subject I would like to teach is special education because of my nephew. He was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder and I have so much experience with him that I know I would be able to handle other children with that temperament.”

HE 4: FA+
Candidate provides strategies that show caring and concern for student well-being.
“I will have to sit down with her and talk to her. I would offer her my help through an open mind. I want it to be clear to my students that my classroom is a safe environment and that their thoughts are welcome, especially if they want someone to hear them out. I want my students to feel comfortable to ask for help academically and emotionally. I would also offer the help of a tutor within class time or after class in order to improve grades.”

“First I would inform the student of their academic standing and stress the importance of them getting back on track. I would remind them that they are not alone in their struggle, and a failure on their part also reflects a failure on my part. I would ask the student of any suggestions they have in order to better learn the material so that they could understand the information better. If I am not able to break through to the student on my own I would involve the student's parent or guardian to assist in the matter.”

- ""I have worked with students from various socioeconomic backgrounds, and I have learnt that you have to accept each child for who they are, and what they bring to the table, especially when working with special needs children. The teacher has to first recognize that each child is different, has different learning styles and needs. Once that is established the teacher has to make accommodations in the lesson to facilitate each child in his or her class. I am a driven individual, who believes in hard work, I love being challenged and I love meeting expectations and goals set for me. I strongly believe that I will be successful raising academic achievements within my subject area through motivation and making learning fun for the students.""
- lowers expectations for students in poverty ""Due to the fact that there are several factors affecting a student's performance within the classroom setting, the teacher has to make allowances for children having difficulties, and modify lessons to meet the needs of each child within the classroom setting. A child may not meet all the required academic goals set for him or her, however, if that child is able to successfully meet some of the academic goals set for him or her without any major assistance, then that could be considered academic success. Children from a lower socioeconomic background may encounter a wide range of issues from violence, exposure to adult situations, abuse and poverty which may result in poor nutrition. These factors can prevent or lower a child's ability to focus or even do the right thing within the classroom setting.""
- different levels of success acceptable depending on child's backgrounds, disabilities ""High academic standards is not necessarily achievable for all students. There are several factors that will determine children's performance, for example, socioeconomic background, parent involvement, and the child's willingness to be taught and to learn. Each child's experiential background plays an active role in their performance in school, and as in the case of special needs children, some of them may not have the wherewithal to be high academic achievers, however, you may get them to master a goal that is set for them in the I.E.P. Sometimes it may be building social skills or to stop or modify a behavior. Each child within the classroom setting is different, their needs also varies. Some will do will academically, while others will meet goals set for them. Once goals are met there is still a level of success. The success, very often will be measured differently based on the setting, socioeconomic status of the students and also whether they are special needs students, the criteria will be very different for each school setting of the child.""
- "" It is the teacher's responsibility to know the child's reading level and provide the child with the appropriate tools to complete assigned tasks, for example, the teacher could provide that child with one to one instruction, where the material would be read aloud for the child or modify the task and questions asked that particular child.""

“Letting them know about the possible opportunities for them is also my job. Such attributes of mine allow me to overcome any challenges or deal with different types of students.”
Teacher-driven solutions
“By understanding all these issues she faces, I would then plan a new lesson and incorporate those ideas and suggestions into it, and then see her response in the classroom.”


HE3 FA
Generally positive, but not enough evidence of to work in high need community, outside general NYC.
“New York City is a melting pot, a city with such diverse groups of people and students, that it's an amazing opportunity to be an educator who can learn and teach all pupil. ”

HE4 FA+

But answers to Part 2 Question 1 indicate some differences in defining success
“… to compare them to students that have had stable households is wrong.”


HE2 FA+ 
Very positive and confident throughout “I love working with kids and I love teaching and I know I can be great at it if given the chance.”
Some solutions involve collaboration with parents/counselors, but all are teacher driven.
“I would spend more one on one time with the student because she need to know that she matters.”

“I have had the pleasure of interacting with kids from low income families while doing rotation in a long term pediatric ward. It's is a fulfilling experience to tutor and help kids that are unable to leave the hospital due to various diseases.”

Candidate mentions diversity in NYC, but not specifically high needs.

1: answers all questions completely
2: relevant
3: direct and clear
HE 
1:  Defines success differently for different students, seems to doubt that all students from low income backgrounds can achieve academically. ""I would define a student’s success as seeing them progress from that level to another by the time the school year ends. This encompasses a variety of things such as attendance and being more engaged. While some may not necessarily improve tremendously on the academic front, we may see them improve in other ways. I think it is important to look at the overall success not just academics because children that usually come from low income families tend to have other risk factors that can often pose a challenge for them achieving academic success. ...Factors such as a student’s socio-economic status, family background and previous school experience can have a serious impact on the potential of their success in the sense that all of these things influence each other to either push or hinder a child's ability to focus.""
2: is mostly confident ""Yes, I do believe I will be successful because I will be looking at each child from an individual standpoint. This will allow me to assess each child's academic success because every individual learns differently and it will very important to learn the various styles of learning taking place on the classroom""""While these strategies are not guaranteed to work in all cases and situations, I do believe they open the door to huge amount of possibilities as to how students learn in the classroom.""
3: wants to give back, has shown commitment to working in low income communities before. 
4: strategies show caring ( talking to the student, tailoring instruction to make it more interesting to her, letting her know she cares)

CT yes -- Candidate answers all questions in full with logical solutions and relevant evidence. All sentences are fairly direct and always link back to the question.

HE yes 
HE1 FA+ ""I define academic success in high-need schools and communities by the smallest of accomplishments."" (P2Q1) ""In my classroom all my students are on different academic levels, so being able to have a student feel accomplished [...] is an achievement for the both of us."" (P2Q2)

(P3Q1) ""Based on the content of her completed work I will find a way to connect it to the current lessons being taught.

HE: Raise student achievement: ""I will be successful in raising student academic achievement in mathematics. I have experience working with low-income students as the Nature Specialist at a summer camp operated by the Children’s Aid Society.""
""Math connects to the arts, sports, nature, and sciences. Math skills also relate to financial literacy, coding skills, geography, and engineering. As an international traveler and global citizen, I believe that math is an international language and connects children with their community and world.""
Academic standards: ""Academic success for students in high-need schools is defined by progress towards national and state standards, and towards goals for individual students and the greater school district. It is important to understand the context of a student’s environment, and to work towards providing the student with the skills to overcome personal challenges and to make academic gains.""
Does not believe she will be successful because of external factors: ""No! I believe that I will struggle, learn, and do my very best to ensure the success of each individual student. But there will be environmental challenges and learning struggles that may prevent a student from high academic achievement. I will do my best to be creative, aware of student needs, and work towards student progress.""
Yet, she will do her best: ""I will improve student outcomes by being very flexible with the implementation of curricula, setting strict classroom rules and behavior expectations, and adapting lessons to meet students’ needs. I will also incorporate lessons that are hands-on, interactive, and fun.""
Shows empathy: ""First, I would seek to identify the problem/s. I would speak with the student herself and speak with the school administration and social worker to learn more about the student’s home life and academic background. I would look at the student’s academic records and see if there are any notes in her history. If possible, I would also involve the child’s parent or guardian to help determine causes and to work in partnership to help the child succeed.""
""First, I would setup a clear pathway to success, providing the student with tools and resources to succeed. This may include determining how the child learns best to tailor resources accordingly. It may include providing targeted after school tutoring, enrichment courses, and summer school. It may also include assessing the student for learning disabilities to help the student get the services that she needs. Second, I would work with the student to set achievable goals, particularly process goals. This may include setting a goal of eating breakfast before school, doing homework with a tutor after school twice a week, and completing all assigned homework. Setting performance goals would come after the process goals are consistently met."" **doesn't really address if this will be successful**

Students should be taught to be able to compete with their counterparts regardless of their socio-economic backgrounds however I do recognize that they will face obstacles based on their circumstances.""
""I believe I will be successful because I believe everybody regardless of socio-economic status should have an opportunity to learn and succeed.

I also think making the subjects relatable to future career outcomes or to their everyday lives can help them stay interested and make the things they learn useful.""
Address potential roadblocks: ""In some circumstances I might not be able to achieve this if the student is completely unwilling to help him or herself out. Also if a student needs additional help at home and the parent is unwilling to cooperate it would be hard to achieve this as well.""
Shows concern for student's wellbeing: ""My first action would be to speak to her in private and give her a chance to explain why she has been behaving that way. If that approach does not work I would contact her parents to see if there is anything at home causing the behavior.""

It should not be a competition with others but rather a competition with one’s self to consistently become better.""
External factors matter: ""I would love nothing more than to guarantee high academic success for all the students I teach, but realistically it’s not a fair promise.

Strategies are neutral.
“I would definitely try to make the subject more engaging, by possibly doing activities that would capture the students attention. I would also speak to the child to find out if there is something bothering her and depending what I am told, taking the next step in helping her be more enthused in the subject, to improve her performance.”

“I would address the students low academic performance is by firstly giving the student different activities that would aid in her being more engaging in the classroom,”

“my next option would probably be to place the student in another classroom setting to see if it is more fitting for her or comfortable.”

Review for Pro, difficult finding the line for “No” re: grammar etc. 


CT: Major deductions for repeating several lines multiple times throughout. 
E.g. the following paragraph shows up four separate times:
“Students attend better during large-group presentations if they cannot predict when they will be required to actively participate. Randomly call on students, occasionally selecting the same student twice in a row or within a short time span. Or pose a question to the class, give students 'wait time' to formulate an answer, and then randomly call on a student.”

HE: 

HE1 FA
Definition of success is very vague, in general seems to expect success but is not directly addressed.
”academic success for them from my perspective if they feel better going to school more than going off school.”

HE2 FA
Many solutions are teacher driven but not enough evidence due to repetitive nature of answers
“Class participation: students attend better during large group presentation.”
“Never use areas designated for quiet work as punitive 'time-out' spaces, as students will then tend to avoid them.”

HE3 FA- 
No real evidence of desire to work in high needs communities, some generalizations:
“we all human and all children from all different backgrounds are the same but low income students may act different because we trade them different.”
“Children raised in poverty rarely choose to behave differently, but they are faced daily with overwhelming challenges that affluent children never have to confront, and their brains have adapted to suboptimal conditions in ways that undermine good school performance. “


HE4 FA
Solutions not individualized, respectfully but lacking evidence of really focusing on individual students.. 
“Class participation: students attend better during large group presentation: Students attend better during large-group presentations if they cannot predict when they will be required to actively participate. Randomly call on students…”


PRO: Unclear if this was proofread, answers are often cut off, and as noted above, sections are repeated multiple times. Minor instances of using incorrect words e.g. “…reduce the fear of math I sow around my community” “we should trade them same way”

I think there are enough mistakes here to warrant a No for Pro 1. Resume and other materials are ok.

Student-driven responses: ""The very first action I would take is to read students’ body language while greeting them into the classroom and assessing her attitude accordingly. I will then pull student aside and ask her how she is doing and depending on her response, how she feels about completing the work. After the student replies I would bargain with the student to get as much work as she can get done, and I will not call on her. In addition to completing work I would ask student to take out a sheet of paper and write down five words about how she's feeling and then explain why.

HE 1: FA
Speaks positively about students’ ability to be academically successful, but definition of academic success is vague or incomplete.
“This success is challenging because each student will have different needs, problems, capacities and abilities. However, I think it is possible with the willingness to help, patience and love for teaching.”

HE 2: FA+ 
Demonstrates confidence and optimism in ability to overcome challenges.
“This strategy will be successful because he will feel I care about he and his learning process, he will feel motivated and that my attention is also focus to him. He also would feel as a school's important part and would be away more time from any problem he might have at home.”

“I believe I will be succesful teaching this area for many reasons. First of all, because I own leadership skills and communication skills that will help me to interact easily with the students. Secondly, I am very patience and sensible with kids, I have the desire to help others and it makes me happy. I am very good in math, so I will feel very confident teaching it, it is easy and fun for me.”

HE 3: FA-
Makes assumptions or generalizations about students/famililies from HN communities that are not outright disrespectful.
“Low income family's children probably don't have high educated parents, friends and relatives, the example of a parent reading a lot of books, the desire to learn,the means to foreign language classes or the opportunity to learn how to play a piano.”

HE 4: FA+
Candidate provides strategies that show caring and concern for student well-being and achievement. 
“I would talk to him aside, ask how he feels, if he has any problems and if he wants to share them with me. Kids need to be understood. If I understand what he is passing through then I will find a way to help him in class and to feel better about life. 

I also may call his parents to expose the situation and ask for possible reasons of is behavior. The clue is to understand his family background and to detect his difficulties.”

“I think I would create different and extra exercises, I will give him more participation in class such as reading the guide book, coming to the class board to increase student-teacher interactions. I would also make him to solve the exercise and if he doesn't explaining him and all class the way to solve it but making sure specially he understands the process.

I would also encourage him to participate in school programs such as sports, music, reading, dance, etc to help him being more involved with school life and activities.”

Or maybe worse, she has autism. Since it is just beginning of school, I may meet her at lunch time, trying to be her friend to know more about her, trying to get her family information and let her open talk with me about how she feels. If possible, I will meet her parents at dismissal time to get information from parents to see what is situation about this girl."" (P3Q1)

Re: demonstrates tenacity
""I remember one time, A 6 years old boy in my Chinese school refused to do any homework and participate in any activity. He was very stubborn and always gave me a hateful look. I tried to let him finish same homework as others. But he just couldn't. Finally, I saw he has booger in his face while sitting in his chair without moving at all. I said to him, how about we clean your booger first and then I help you with your homework? That seems worked a little bit. In the end, he hesitantly try to read article and learn to write new characters."" (P2Q2)

CT 3: Negative.  ""Teaching isn't just a job, really you can't just go to work and plod through the day children's lives are involved"" (Part 1, Q2).   Again, ""I think in order for these students to succeed there should be some building blocks as an instructor there should be a culture of high expectations and caring for the students"" (Part 2, Q1).

Not entirely consistent, however.

""They are not independent learners, they are not resilient, they are unable to do research and then watching them learn life skills, you see the growing up into fine young adults before your eyes"" (Part 1, Q2).   Also in Part 2, Q2, goes on tangent about low-income students when the question is not asking about it.   Also goes on tangents regarding problems with what vs how children learn in Part 3, Q2.
