Aaron earned an E on the TSPF. The activities, questions and CFU were logical and aligned to the objective and would facilitate student mastery. Teacher and student actions were explained in detail.

Aaron earned an FA in TP because he was visibly nervous at times, but maintained a formal tone, eye contact and an appropriate volume of voice. Aaron's overall TS was FA+. Aaron's strength was ES because he engaged all students once by assigning a math problem. He took volunteers and cold called one student, which meant that he provided students more than one way to participate in his lesson. In CD Aaron was FA because he attempted to model and to check for understanding. Aaron ensured that students understood the difference between a radius and diameter, but did not actually show students how to plug the radius and/or diameter into the area formula. By assigning a problem, he attempted to assess the objective in part. With respect to MIT, Aaron was FA+. Although he referred to his notes several times, it did not disrupt the flow of his TS. 

In the GA, Aaron earned an FA+ because his initial directions were concrete, specific and observable, he gave feedback that improved his partner's directions and he was able to incorporate staff feedback. 

In the TSRT Aaron delivered one set of WTD directions that were specific, concrete, sequential and observable. He earned an FA+ because the directions led students to completing an academic task. ",,,#N/A

In terms of TS he was rated FA+ due to FA+ in ES.  

In terms of ES he was rated FA+.  His lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  He purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example he had students write the definitions on their handout, students answered questions about the content, students read, and students identified fact and opinions and supported their answer with a reason.  These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, he gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students read from the handout, answered questions, copied definitions, and responded to questions verbally.  He also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students complete an end assignment of writing their own examples of fact and opinion.  During the lesson he cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall he intentional engaged all the students throughout his lesson.

In terms of CT there was conflicting evidence, FA- and FA+ but an overall rating of FA.

First, his TSPF was rated FA+.  He included clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  His directions were step by step and included a student activity of students reading and annotating a poem for fact and opinion.  He also included a logical check for student understanding using a handout and having students write their own fact and opinion.  All of his key points are aligned to his objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.

In terms of the GA he was rated FA-.  During the planning for practice part of the GA he was confused about the task and did not follow the directions given.  For example, he did not write his revised direction as a direction, he wrote it as a list not for students but for him.  For example, I would ask students to take out their assignments.  Also, his scenario asked him to get the students discussing problem one but his direction had the students write down key points and not discuss.  Overall his GA was not clear and he did not analyze the information accurately.  

Overall he exceeds the bar with an FA+ in ES but an FA- in the GA.  I am asking for a please review due to the conflicting evidence and if the GA CT would warrant an NFA and a select out.  



","Candidate merits FA- in his GA due to confusion and incoherence, but does not fully cross the line into NFA. He therefore received a CTO rating of FA which means he meets the bar for selection into the program. Note selector's concern with his confusion in regards to the GA.","film degree: 7/2011

His lesson on plotting coordinates on a plane was strong in ES, CA, and CD. The lesson was strongly aligned with the obj -- he began by having S review how to plot points on a number line, then he defined the necessary terms, then he showed S how to plot 2 points, then S plotted their own points on the exit slip. Besides a slightly long detour into how to number quadrants, his lesson was strong in CA, an FA+. In CD, his obj was clear, he used a model to demonstrate the steps of plotting points, and he had 1 CFU with S plotting their own points, so he was FA+. In ES, some S answered Qs aloud and all S completed the exit slip, so he was FA+ in ES. His lesson ran out of time at the end, so FA in MIT. Overall, his lesson was a strong FA+ overall. Alber was also strong in TP: he was audible throughout, confident, and made eye contact w/S.

During the GA, he drafted directions that had some elements of concrete and obs, but did not include seq or specific steps. He was somewhat defensive while receiving fdbk, but attempted to incorporate the fdbk into his directions. He gave good fdbk to others. He was open to my fdbk, but not entirely successful in implementing it. Thus, he was FA in GA CT. During the TSR, he incorporated WTD 1x, used 3/4 of the components, and improved the clarity of the S activity, and was thus FA+ in TSR CT and FA+ in CTO.

A review of his file indicates no concerns. He was highly rated by his prescreener and skipped the phone interview.

Alex was very strong in his teaching sample overall.  Alex demonstrated a keen understanding how how to prepare a TSPF and how to deliver the content and engage the students.  Alex is a paraprofessional and has spent a lot of time in the classroom and so he understands these specific components.  What Alex lacks mostly is the critical thinking component, in comparison to his teaching sample.  Alex exhibits a lack of understanding of WTD which was apparent when his initial WTD in his GA did not even match the goal result of the WTD in the practice scenario.  However, after receiving feedback from peers, and listening to everyone else, he did change his WTD to fit more with the scenario during his revision.  Moreover, the fact that he did implement a component or two of WTD in his re-teach shows that he did retain something, but it also reinforced his true lack of understanding.  Based on his E on TSOR and the fact that there are signs of an ability to learn critical thinking, I believe with help during PST, Alex would be capable of learning the skills to be an effective teacher.

Student and teacher actions are listed but in uneven detail.  Teacher actions are scripted clearly, however student actions lack detail consistently throughout in some places on the TSPF.

Alexis begins the lesson confidently and definitely used a variety of tones to be engaging throughout the teaching sample.  Alexis interprets the objective almost fully, however, she does not use a text to help students distinguish between figurative and literal language. She used a series of sentences.  Despite this, the entire lesson focused on distinguishing between literal and figurative language and what the meaning of each is.  Each time a student responded to a question, Alexis required that they explain how they know, or why is the answer they chose correct.  Alexis engaged every student except one student at least once.  She primarily relied on student volunteers, but did cold call on one student.  Students were required to underline figurative words and circle literal words on the worksheet as an additional form of engagement.  Alexis maximized her instructional time, as the lesson was not rushed, had a steady pace and she spent the most time continually checking for student understanding by having them support all answers with evidence.  During the group activity, Alexis stayed on topic and was focused. She gave glow and grows from the feedback cheat sheet to each of her group members and even suggested ways in which group members could improve their directions.

Alla was warm and confident and faced the class, and used a varied tone, receiving an E in TP. Her content was accurate throughout and fully aligned, except more time was allocated to finding the b and h of the triangles than students practicing applying the actual formula, receiving an FA+ in CA. She used a model  and the objective was clear, students did not all fully practice the lesson independently but she did have students support their response with her follow up questions, receiving an FA+ in CD. She engaged all students with her guided notes and some with questions, receiving an FA+ in ES. The lesson was slightly rushed to allow for the homework, which was unclear if they was additional practice she did not get to or extra materials she prepared for the candidates. She received an FA+ in Mit. The lesson was FA+ overall due to the FA+ in ES and CD. Alla was strong in the GA and offered critical feedback to all 3 partners. Her initial directions were very long winded and she narrated parts, but she understood how to incorporate wtd over multiple parts of a lesson. She incorporated by directions in the practice by adding a time frame, but it was not a logical amount of time for each student to share their hw answer (5 min) She received an FA+ in the GA. In the re-teach, Alla incorporated wtd to have students complete an example in partners. She did not have a concrete element but had multiple observables. She repeated her directions several times which was somewhat imperfect and in a confusing sequence. She received an FA in the re-teach.

She earned an FA+ in CA (lesson activities were aligned, info was accurate, answer to my Q was a little hard to understand), an FA in ES (all S answered at least one Q aloud, but no other way for S to participate in the lesson), FA in CD (obj was clear, model was used, but CFU did not cover the entire obj -- S did not ID stages of plot in a story, but defined them). Thus, she was FA in TSO.

During the GA, she drafted directions that did not focus on the goal of having S discuss their answers (she mostly focused on how to get the HW out for discussion). She attempted to give fdbk to her partners, but it wasn't always clear or logical. She was open to fdbk from me and attempted to incorporate it into her direction, but not totally in a logical way. Thus, she was FA in GA CT.

TSPF CT: FA Andres provided a basic lesson, and it was, at points vague as to whether students would be completing number lines or just identifying vocabulary words.  Ultimately, I was able to discern that there was a connection between student actions and the objective.  The lesson's activities, then, were logically aligned and the CFU was logical, as it required students to work independently on a worksheet, applying a skill. TP: FA+ Andres was consistently confident throughout his lesson, attempting to be engaging with his movement and his voice.  He spoke at an appropriate volume and maintained a formal tone.  He maintained eye contact throughout the lesson and consistently faced his students, speaking succinctly and there were points of EOL as he delivered his information.  CA: FA+ His interpretation of the information was correct and his lesson addressed it in full.  He prioritized the content and spent the entire time on his content, using examples, materials, and activities that reinforced the objective.  The information he conveyed was accurate, but he made a minor inaccuracy when he used a 'less-than or equal to' as opposed to a 'less-than' symbol.  CD: FA The objective was clear and he used two models to present his information, but only had an attempt for CFU, not having sufficient time to have students complete the CFU or discuss it.  ES: FA+ He purposefully had all students participate at least once: writing the objective, answering questions, reading problems, and solving an equation.  MIT: FA The lesson was generally steady, but he had to rush to finish his lesson.   GA CT: FA+ During the group activity, Andres's initial WTD instruction included all elements of the skill.  He offered multiple pieces of feedback to his partners, helping them to make significant improvements to their WTD instructions.  His revised instructions included my feedback, but was focused on changing his observable.  TSRT CT: FA+ During his reteach, Andres incorporated two instances of WTD instructions that drove his lesson forward and got students to complete an academic task, which he was unable to do in his initial lesson.

Overall the TSPF was FA+. The candidate planned a lesson on teaching the author's purpose in a text. The candidate's planned mini lesson was logically aligned the objective, and the candidate included relevant practice with CFU at 2 points in the lesson. The CFU was logical and addresses the lesson objective in full by having students identify the author's purpose as well as create examples. Both teacher and student actions were outlined in detail. 

Overall, Anthony's teaching sample was rated FA+. He taught a lesson and was prepared with an anchor chart. handouts, and examples. He used CFU appropriately and his model was clear and concise. 
TP - FA+. The candidate was confident for the majority of the lesson and attempted to engage students. The candidate projected his voice loudly enough so that all students could hear and his tone remained formal for the duration of the lesson. The candidate made eye contact with students and did not turn his back for more than a few seconds. The candidate spoke succinctly and only lost economy of language when answering questions. 
CA - FA. The candidate's interpretation of the provided objective was correct and the lesson addressed the full objective. The candidate prioritized some important content, but did not give an example of ""entertain"" until asked as one was not present in the article for the class. The candidate conveyed accurate content necessary for students to achieve the stated objective and answered questions accurately. 
CD - FA+. The lesson objective was clear to students and was presented at the beginning of the lesson. The candidate defined terms, used a model paragraph, and questioning. The candidate used a CFU during the reading to help students identify different purposes. The candidate asked students to write statement to persuade, inform, or entertain. 
ES - FA. The candidate purposefully engaged all participants at least once during the lesson by questioning. The candidate gave participants more than one way to participate in the lesson (verbally answering questions and writing). The candidate addresses all questions, but had a slow response time to raised hands. 
MIT - FA. The lesson pace was generally steady and the candidate presented a slow finish to the lesson. The candidate finished the lesson less than a minute early and referred to lesson notes, but did not stop the lesson to do so. The candidate took longer than a minute to set up and lost some time on the beginning of his lesson while writing on the board and passing out papers. 

Overall, Anthony's participation in the GA and RT showed a deep understanding of WTD and his ability to take and implement feedback well. Anthony fully incorporated WTD at multiple points in his lesson during his RT in a way that allowed him to CFU and drive instruction forward. 
GA - FA+. During the group activity, the candidate stayed on topic and gave appropriate glows and grows to the group members that helped them improve their directions. The candidate's proposed directions incorporated multiple aspects of WTD. He gave logical feedback to his partners to make their directions more specific and observable. He incorporated feedback with 100% accuracy. 
RT - E. The candidate incorporated feedback to include 3 components of WTD in 2 places in his lesson. He fully applied the written feedback from his sample lesson and incorporated WTD in a way that drove instruction forward as well as allowed him to CFU. The candidate used a variety of components of WTD that demonstrates mastery and understanding of the purpose of WTD.

He earned an FA+ in TSPF Critical Thinking. During his Teaching Sample, Anthony used two texts by Langston Hughes to have students engage in the activity of locating examples of literary and figurative language. He provided a poster with the objective listed for the lesson and with definitions of the terms literary and figurative language.  When I posed a question asking what ""literary devices"" are, which was included in his definition of figurative language, he responded by listing examples of literary devices (simile, metaphor, etc) that can be used. He had students engage in activities using the poems provided to identify examples of the different types of language. He earned an FA+ in Teaching Sample Overall.  During his Group Activity, Anthony provided feedback to his group members that was aligned to the framework, made sense, and helped move their WTD directions forward.  When he was provided with feedback from me, he appeared stuck for a moment during his reimplementation and was unable to remember the feedback, so he repeated the same  direction he had delivered the first time. He apologized afterwards and said that he drew a blank but that he would incorporate it into his re-teach. His critical thinking, use of multiple elements of WTD in his revised direction, and appropriate and helpful feedback to his peers keeps his rating at an FA for Group Activity CT, despite his lack of incorporation of my feedback during practice.  During his re-teach, he used multiple observables and specific directions to drive instruction forward. He  incorporated all of the feedback that I gave him on the Group Activity worksheet, including annotating the text and giving clear directions to guide  students to copy down the definitions he is using.

He did include a minor extra piece of information, but it was logical for the objective and content. He was not specific with what his questions would be of students nor did he explain the student and teacher actions in detail. During his teaching sample, he was confident and engaging. His tone and volume were appropriate. He did briefly turn his back to the students, but overall it was not enough to keep him out of an FA+ for teacher presence. He interpreted the objective correctly, and his content was accurate. His lesson materials were logical and related to the objective. He did not spend enough time on the ""key phrases"" part of the objective for an FA+ in content alignment, however. The lesson objective was explicitly stated at the beginning of the lesson. He used a model and presented informational lineraly to convey understanding. He attempted to check for understanding. He engaged students at least once by having them read from a handout. He also had students answer verbal questions. The lesson pace was generally steady, but he did have a rushed finish. During the group activity he stayed on topic and was able to deliver WTD directions that were specific, observable and concrete. He was also able to provide group members with actionable feedback that improved their directions. During the reteach he was able to incorporate WTD directions that were clear but not specifically academic. Also, there were some missed opportunities for more WTD directions.

The key points were aligned to the objective and the  form was completed logically. The lesson activities are logically aligned to the lesson and he mentioned what students will be doing throughout the lesson. During the TS, Ari was confident consistently and varied his tone in an attempt to be engaging. He maintained eye contact with students consistently and was almost always facing the class. He spoke succinctly and clearly, with instances of economy of language, especially when giving directions. He earned an FA+ rating for TP. His interpretation of the provided objective was correct and the lesson addressed the full objective. He prioritized content and spent the most time on what was important for mastery of the objective. Ari conveyed accurate content during the planned lesson, but failed to address some minor details like why circles should be open or closed on a number line when dealing with inequalities. The lesson objective was mostly clear to students as it was implied in the do now task and Ari mentioned we would work with plotting inequalities on a number line about 1 minute into the lesson so it was clear to students. He used a model to convey information and checked for understanding multiple times with two written activities and by asking for volunteers to answer questions. He earned an E rating for CD and an FA+ for ES. During the GA Ari's initial planned direction was observable, sequential and specific. He offered her partner's feedback that would help make their directions more concrete and specific. He incorporated his partner's and the selector's feedback. Ari earned an FA+ rating for the GA. During the re-teach Ari's directions made sense in the context of his lesson and moved students to complete an academic task (the do now). His directions incorporated two WTD components and he earned an FA+ rating.

In TP Ari scored an FA+. He was confident through out the lesson and he projected his voice with an appropriate tone. He observed economy of language at some points. In CA he scored a FA-. He provided many examples and modeled many examples of figurative meaning but neglected to spend time on the literal definition of words or phrases and to identify them. He used logical examples but the literal meaning of the examples in the first set of text was somewhat confusing. He conveyed accurate content about what the figurative meaning of words are (different than the literal interpretation of words). In CD he scored an FA+. The lesson objective is clear to participants. He used materials that supported mastery of the objective (an article and poem). He attempted to CFU and he asked students for evidence why the terms were literal and figurative. In ES he scored an FA+. Some sutudents raised their hand to share an answer. All students analyzed the poem on their paper. In MIT he scored an FA. He presented a completed lesson but he ended the lesson about 15 seconds early. 

In the TSPF Ari scored an FA+. Planned activities of analyzing text seems to address the objective. Teacher action and student action seem to be explained in detial. Some of the content (key points) does not directly align to identifying the difference between the literal and figurative mean in of text. She stated ""Figurative language helps strengthen an author’s point. Using figurative language enables authors to voice their creativity while making a point""

In the GA Ari scored an FA+ in the GA. He provided feedback to his partner to be more specific about where they should put the materials and be specific about where their notebook and pen could be. In the direction he presented to me he included all elements and he questioned the feedback the group gave (should I include another time??). He suggested to his partner to be specific about what thumb to put up and what finger to put on the heading. In the direction he presented to me. In the direction he presented to me it was missing a specific element of time to have students take out their materials. He was able to incorporate my feedback into the direction 

In the TSRT he gave an incomplete direction to have students take out the worksheet. He then gave students a complete direction to have them complete the poem analysis. He incorporated my feedback in the TSRT. Overall he scored an FA+ in the TSRT. ",,"english degree conferred 5/2016

He made a minor error when explaining to the students, but caught it and corrected himself. The participants were a little confused about the differences between primary and secondary consumers, due to Arthur's lack of fully explaining the definition.

It was planned logically and completely and key points were aligned and explained in detail.  His activity included clear instructions for what students would be doing during the class. Check for understanding is clear and addresses the lesson objective and content. His lesson did not include any extraneous information. 
Arthur received an FA+ for the TS overall. His strength was in CA where he received an exemplary based on how he was able to align all of the activities and prioritize the most important content in order for the students to get the most out of the lesson. His ES was a FA+ and was another strength because all students were given opportunities to participate in the lesson in multiple ways. His CD was very good, including when he stated ""FOIL is like 'spreading the love' a metaphor that he reiterated throughout the lesson and this helped students with the CFU as evidenced by their referencing it to describe the FOIL method. A weakness in CD was that the information was presented in a linear way. During the GA, Arthur was able to integrate all of his peers feedback. He also provided glows and grows to his peers that supported them in writing better WTD. His proposed WTD included only 3 components, and he needed to make them more observable. The RT was another strength for him. During the RT, he was able to use the WTD to move students through the content and successfully complete the task. This made him an FA+, he also incorporated WTD multiple times, however the second time was not as clear as the first. He also successfully used the observable, sequential, concrete and sequential. He only gave one method of observable directions and did not demonstrate mastery. He very successfully incorporated the selectors feedback.

TSPF CT: FA- Aurora's lesson was basic and the connection between both her objective and key points were logical.  Her lesson was sufficiently detailed to determine both teacher and student actions throughout, although at certain points, students were performing no actions, as specified by her plan.  However, the CFU was logical.  TP:  FA+ Aurora was consistently confident throughout the lesson and attempted engagement through her voice and body language.  She projected at a tone that was appropriate and maintained an appropriate tone.  She maintained eye contact throughout the lesson and was consistently facing the class.  She spoke succinctly and clearly, with instances of EOL.  CA: FA Her interpretation of the objective was correct and she addressed it completely, using examples, activities, and materials related to the objective.  She conveyed accurate information throughout, but her response to my question was a little confusing.  CD: FA Her objective was clear because she stated it and had students read along with her.  She presented the information linearly and modeled to convey the information, using materials and questioning to help support mastery of the objective.  She attempted a CFU, but took over, as time began to run out.  ES: FA Since she asked students not to do anything, there was only one opportunity for students to participate, which was to answer questions.  She asked 4/7 students to participate by answering questions or reading.  The instruction didn't drive the lesson forward.  MIT: FA- The lesson was generally steady, but she spent too much time on the direct teaching of the lesson, which caused her to miss a key component of the lesson, the student practice and CFU.  GA CT: FA Aurora's initial WTD instructions included 3/4 of the elements, as the sequence was slightly illogical.  She gave strong feedback to her partners, helping to improve their feedback, although her unwillingness to accept my feedback stymied her final WTD instruction, resulting in her not changing much of her instructions.  TSRT CT: FA+ While it was ever so slightly imperfect, Aurora's WTD instructions did get students to complete an academic task, which also resulted in an improvement on her initial lesson.  She consistently demonstrated an understanding of the purpose and utility of the skill.  ",,Bachelor's and Master's in Industrial Management conferred 2010 (WES evaluation),#N/A

The teacher and student actions were detailed and the lesson activities were logical but the CFU did not apply the skill. During the teaching sample his TP was FA+.  He was consistently confident throughout the lesson and he was always facing the class, even when he was showing the math work on the board.  He also attempted to engage throughout the variation of tone. His TSO was E.  He clearly stated the objective at the beginning of the lesson, to multiply binomials using the foil method. He modeled the skill clearly for the students and asked questions that CFU during the model. A student responded incorrectly to the question and he adjusted his teaching to address the misconception. His CFU at the end of the lesson had the students apply the skill on a worksheet (CD E).  All the lesson materials and questions were aligned to the objective but they did not facilitate mastery. (CA- FA+).  He engaged most of the students through questions and all students completed a worksheet. (ES- FA+).  His MIT was also E.  The lesson was steady and there was no need for adjustment of time, he finished perfectly on time and he got through all the planned material. During the GA he showed a clear understanding of the skill of WTD.  He provided clear feedback that related to the WTD skills to his group and his final set of directions incorporated all the elements.  His feedback was EOL, and he incorporated that feedback. During the reteach, he started the portion by using WTD to gather their attention, and then gave clear WTD to pull out the worksheet and find number two.  He then gave clear WTD to complete the questions and used an observable to show they were done.  He then just waited for everyone to finish and said he was done at 1:45.  There was a missed opportunity to use WTD to share work (FA+).  Overall because of many spikes throughout the event I recommend him to the program. ",,"Education tab - Journalism & Comm major

Even when she was modeling the coordinates on the board, she was able to do so without turning her back to the class for long periods of time. She maintained eye contact and was able to answer my question succinctly and logically. Bettina received an FA+ in ES because all students participated at least once when they had to practice in pairs how to find the coordinate plane on a worksheet. Not an E because she even though she attempted a choral response, not all students were participating. She also received an FA+ in CD because the model and CFU's were clearly used to check for mastery with the class, she called on volunteers to show that students could plot points and periodically asked students questions like why the point was located in the position according to the X and Y. 

Group Activity: Bettina was strong in the GA. She was able to take and receive feedback as well as incorporating multiple components of the WTD technique. She was very specific, giving chapter and page numbers, gave a clear observable for multiple steps of the directions, and they were sequential. 

Reteach: Bettina was able to incorporate at least 2 components of WTD in her Re-Teach. She gave clear observables while she was modeling to show that the students were following along with what she was doing on the board. She also gave WTD for students to put material on their desk before she began her model. She used WTD to begin an academic task, used it multiple times, which is why she received a FA+.

Overall Bettina is a stong candidate, her TSO and CTO were strong. Her TP showed a clear command of confidence and her delivery was strong in the material that could otherwise get very confusing. ",,"prefers english and sped english but no degree

He attempts to be engaing by varying his tone. He projects his voice at an appropriate vloume and maintains eye contact (Teacher Presence: FA+).  In terms of Content Alignment, He uses examples and activities that convey accurate content and are related to the lesson objective (FA+).. In terms of Content Delivery, the lesson objective is mostly clear to students although it was not explicitly stated to students. (FA+). In terms of Engaging students, he purposefully engaged most participants at least once and offer more than one way to participate in the lesson. However, he ignored my raised hand more than once (FA). Bonny finishes the lesson but it is shortened. He spent the majority of time on the most important activities. During the group activity, he was able to give accurate WTD that were concrete, sequential, and observable. He was able to offer feedbaack to his peers (both glows and grows). In his reteach, he was able to give directions that incorporates two or more components of WTD. His directions made sense in the context of his lesson. Overall, Bonny is a strong candidate and should be accepted to NYCTF. He met or exceeded the model in all parts of the interview process.

The TSPF is completed logically and appropriately.  There are several key points listed and outlined and they are clearly aligned to the chosen objective.  Teacher and student actions are clearly outlined and detailed.  There is a check for understanding where students will answer a series of questions to determine their level of understanding. Calvin began the lesson confidently and remained that way the entire lesson.  He used a variety of tones in order to engage his students.  The interpretation is correct and partially full.  Calvin explained how to classify metals, nonmetals and semi-metals, but did not explain how to classify halogen clearly.  He used a the periodic table of elements as a model, but it wasn't exactly clear how students were supposed to utilize the periodic table to classify the elements. He engaged students in multiple ways.  He took volunteers to answer questions and cold called students as well.  Students did not do a lot of writing that moved them towards understanding the objective, and did little to no thinking.  Calvin did lecture for a large portion of the lesson and did not allow students sufficient time to practice classifying the metals.  However, towards the end of the lesson, Calvin attempted to check for understanding but did run out of time.  During the group activity, Calvin remained on task and focused.  He gave feedback to his group members using the feedback cheat sheet.  At times he even gave specific examples on how group members could make their WTD stronger.  Since Calvin was a high performing candidate and had all components of WTD in his initial revised directions, the selector feedback was for Calvin to limit the use of his notes.  He attempted to do so, but his WTD lost the concrete component.  Despite this, he was still able to clearly demonstrate his understanding of the skill, especially during the reteach.  During the reteach, Calvin successfully incorporated WTD into his lesson.  Although it wasn’t necessarily for the completion of an academic task, it was to have student’s copy down a chart to help them understand the classification of the elements.  Calvin directed, ""If you look on the board, I drew this chart.  Now, you should all take twenty seconds to quietly write this chart down. When you are all done, I want you to put your pencils down and look up at me.""  These WTD clearly demonstrate his understanding of the skill and incorporate all components in part.

Cary was FA for TP, she was audible, confident, and engaging in her initial TS, but less so in her Reteach.  She mostly maintained eye contact, only turning to write on board.  

Cary was E for CA; her content was aligned, correct, and her examples were accurate.  She expanded upon her response to m question by including further information.  Cary was FA+ for CD; she clearly stated her objective, presented information linearly, asking S to help her with examples before adding her own and then ending with having S identify text samples and explain why (CFA).   Cary was FA+ for ES; all students were engaged at least once in at least one of the following ways: cold call or identifying example, and all were engaged with a choral response at the end (but this choral response did not drive academic instruction, it was really a reading).  Cary was FA for MIT, she wrapped up a little earlier than she needed to and could've asked one more question, but she was fully FA.     

Cary was FA for GACT; her initial direction included multiple components of WTD and she applied my coaching FB.  Her feedback to  others was less helpful, although she tried, and there were brief moments where she was confused by the activity.  Overall she had mixed evidence for this portion but appears to meet the bar for FA overall.

Cassandra spoke succinctly and clearly and when asked a question from the selector, she answered using economy of language in a way that the question was answered quickly and effectively.  The chosen objective was interpreted correctly and the lesson and lesson activities fully addressed the objective.  She spent the majority of the lesson explaining what longitude and latitude is and how to find a place on those lines utilizing a model. She did activity one with students to clearly model how to find longitude and latitude.  At the beginning of the lesson, Cassandra clearly stated the objective so that it would be known to students.  She checked for understanding towards the end of the lesson by asking a series of three questions.  The questions started off basic, she just asked students what longitude and latitude is.  Then the questions increased in difficulty as she asked what the difference between the two is. She even pushed one student volunteer to explain how they were able to locate a coordinate. Cassandra engaged 3 out of 6 students regularly by asking questions and taking volunteers.  Students were also required to utilize the worksheet by finding and tracing latitude and longitude lines.  Cassandra was able to summarize and ask check for understanding questions within her teaching time and finished with 6 seconds remaining.  The lesson has a steady pace and did not feel rushed. During the group activity, Cassandra remained focused and on task. She was able to give her group members glows and grows from the feedback cheat sheet.  At one point, she even gave a group member a suggestion and example of how to make their directions even more observable.

She checks for understanding by asking students what the main idea and details are and asks them to ""how?"", having them support their answers with evidence. In ES, Chrisina earned an E. She had all students participate in the lesson through cold call, volunteering, and writing down answers on a worksheet. In MIT, Chrisina earned an E> the lesson place is steady and no time is wasted. Although she finishes 8s early, the entire lesson from the TSPF is used, using the time to advance student understanding of finding main idea and the supporting details in a text.

In CT, Chrisina earned an FA+. In the GA, Chrisina earned an FA+ Her original revision incorporated three components of WTD, with a weakness in sequential, as the steps were not linear. She incorporated my feedback of changing her observable to be more specific. She consistently gave constructive feedback to her peers to improve their WTD directions.

He will make an excellent candidate and will excel in the summer training. 
Christian's TSPF was rated as a FA. It was planned logically and completely and key points were aligned and explained, the only weakness was that the student actions were not explained in detail. The TS overall was rated FA for the following reasons:TP- FA, Christian was confident during the lesson and projected his voice. He has an engaging demeanor at the front of the class. He frequently made eye contact during the lesson but he turned his back several times in the lesson. He also had a strength with economy of language. 
ES- FA, during the lesson he was purposeful about engaging all of the students at least one time either by doing a cold call (3 students) or asking for volunteers (3 students). He also gave students a chance to engage in the lesson verbally, by answering questions and in written using the worksheet which he did not finish. 
CA- FA, while the lesson was well aligned with the objective during the mini-lesson, his check for understanding was to have students ""Create their own ending to a story."" This was not aligned well. Students did not spend a significant amount of time on this part however. After students went through each part  of the plot, he related the setting of To Kill a Mockingbird to exposition to show understanding. 
CD- He received an FA in CD because of the model that he provided students with content from to kill a mockingbird. He also had students apply the skill to highlight which part is the exposition. 
MIT- He received an FA+ in MIT, which was a strength for him because he got to the check for understanding and students got a chance to apply the skill.
Christian received an FA+ for the GA. He took all feedback from his peers and provided actionable glows and grows for the other candidates. His initial directions included an observable (place pencils down) and were concrete (silently). In the redo of the WTD he incorporated the feedback to ""show of hands, who has their materials out and is ready"" that was given by his peer. 
During the RT, Christian received an E, he effectively made the directions specific (name in right corner, date in left), observable (when done all eyes on me) and sequential (first put your work in front of you, then put name in corner, when done eyes on me). He could have made his directions more concrete, but overall he incorporated WTD at 3 stages of the lesson and really pushed the learning forward. He also asked clarifying questions and was very open to feedback. He used two types of observables, pick up your pencil and all eyes on me. In reviewing his file, there are no flags and he presented as being coachable during the selection event, for these reasons he should be selected in as a good candidate.

In the TSPF Christopher scored an FA+. All key points about the stages of plot seem to be alined to the objective. The form is filled out logically and most teacher action and student action is explained in detail. Students are asked to identify the triangle and label the triangle angles. The CFU is for students to fill in the missing angle, and then determine which type of triangle it is.

In TP Christopher scored an FA+. He was confident through out the lesson and he projected his voice with an appropriate tone. He observed economy of language at some points. In CA he scored an FA+. He fully interpreted the objective but he didn't prioritize content on what was most important. He discussed in detail how to identify the angle amounts of the missing angles. He otherwise conveyed accurate content the entire time about the three types of triangles. In CD he scored an FA+. He asked students to support their answers with evidence such as asking ""what does each angle measure? how do you know?"" and then when students were explaining the practice they explained how they got the type of triangle they identified. In ES he scored an FA+. All students chorally shouted out the answer, all students answered the written practice problems, and all students wrote down the notes. Some students raised their hand to share answers. In MIT she scored an E. The lesson pace was steady and he completed the entire lesson which was described on the planning form. Most of the time was identifying the types of triangles. Overall he scored an FA+ in the TS.

In the direction he presented to the group it included all elements. He suggested to his partner to tell students to speak one at a time. He suggested to one partner to include a time frame. He suggested to his partner to include silently to complete the direction.  In the GA my feedback was to tell students specifically how they should underline.

However, once he began the lesson, he maintained appropriate eye contact, voice volume and tone. He had an ease to his delivery, and even though he was a clear accent, it did not impede understanding of his delivery. Candidate received a FA in ES because most students participated at least once, rather than all. He did not have students write anything, besides the definition that was on the board, that's not really testing their understanding. He also recieved an FA in CD because the delivery of the lesson was fairly linear: definitions, examples, text, questions.

Group Activity: Clement really shined in the Group Activity. He is very methodical and this came out. Even when other candidates thought the directions given were good, Clemente was able to think of hypothetical or specific scenarios where if they did something different, it could improve the direction given. He gave strong directions and was able to incorporate my feedback but saying his directions in less words. Overall he will have to work on his economy of language, in general though. 

Re-Teach: Clement demonstrated a clear understanding of the purpose of What to Do and incorporated to multiple parts of the lesson. He used it to the transition the class into a class reading of the ""I Have a Dream"" speech as well as when the students were wrapping up their underlining He used it to complete and academic task, however since he only really had 2 components, specific and observable, this is what kept him from getting an E.

Clement is a strong candidate for PST. Even though he demonstrated an tendency to be a little wordy, asking questions (not inappropriate, applicable to a classroom) and he had a lot to say during the check in during hte planning time for the re-teach. however he is very methodical which  should be able to help him over the summer.

For this reason her TSPF CT was an FA. During her Teaching Sample, she utilized visuals on the board and asked for student volunteers for responses to answers, but the answers were also listed on the board and on handouts in front of each student so it was unclear if they were reading the definitions or if they knew them.  She spent the duration of the time asking students to define the different elements of the plot and then had them skim a text to identify the plot points, but they did not get a chance to complete the task as they ran out of time. Her TS Overall was FA due to an FA in Engages Students, Maximizing Instructional Time, and Content Delivery.  During her Group Activity, she offered feedback to move a group member forward but did not offer any grows to her assigned group member.

He has planned teacher and student actions that clearly move students forward towards mastery of the objective.  During his Teaching Sample, he projected his voice at a constant tone, he engaged students in responding to problems and utilizing their worksheets he provided, and he modeled an example on the board.  He responded to my question accurately and succinctly when I asked why the variable x was used and not z by explaining that the letter just represents a number, and we could use z, it's just that x is the most commonly used variable. He then returned to the lesson and did not break pace by answering my question. He received an FA in Maximizing Instructional Time because the ending to the lesson was rushed and did not get to the entirety of what he had planned, but he received an FA+ in all other areas during his Teaching Sample, so his TSO was an FA+. During  his Group Activity, David offered feedback that moved his groupmates forward and incorporated at least two WTD directions in his initial revision. Based on his group members' feedback, his revised direction was high performing and my feedback to him was to limit his use of notes and make eye contact with his students, which he successfully did.  He received an FA+ in his GA and an FA+ in his Re-teach, as he incorporates specific and observable directions to move his instrution forward. Final Decision: Select In.","David was previously selected into the program, but did not move forward with the position due to a job that allowed him to work with students.

For CA, David used examples that were mostly logical and relevant to the objective, but some of the delivery was confusing to the participants. He responded accurately to the question posed by the selector. For CD, David explicitly stated the objective to the class and used his activity as a check for understanding that asked the students to apply the skill they learned, but did not ask them to support their answer with evidence. For ES, David engaged all of the candidates at least once using multiple modes, mostly volunteers and some cold calls. For MIT, the lesson pace is steady and he shortens the lesson to finish it, but it did not seem rushed. For the group activity, David gave logical feedback to his partners and helped to make one candidate's directions more concrete. He stayed on task and his initial prosed directions had most of the components of WTD, but his revised directions accurately incorporated all of the feedback given to him. For the re-teach, David accurately incorporated WTD directions in the re-teach and it lead students towards successfully completing a task, but he missed out on the opportunity to use it more than once because he ended the lesson quickly.

He really used variation of tone and projected confidence in front of the class for FA+ in TP. His TSO was less successful, coming in at a FA rating. He was FA in ES for asking most students a question but not otherwise engaging them (he assigns HW but they do not get to try it), FA in CD for using a model and stating the objective, but not checking for understanding, and FA in CA for having a very confusing and complicated example of triangle congruency (they were overlapping triangles, where separate triangles would be a more clear and simple way to illustrate the hypotenuse leg theorem for the first time - so he had some extraneous details, but all his information was correct. He was FA in the TSRTCT, because his only WTD was "". To prepare, take  a minute to take out a pen and a piece of paper. When you finish doing that give me a thumbs up."" In GACT, he participated logically, and was FA+ because he gave some logical feedback to a partner, and successfully implemented my feedbacks. So with FA in the TSO, but FA+ in CTO and TP, he is selected in and recommended.

However, his economy of language was a bit of a hindrance. He had moments of being non-succint and when answer the question asked he showed some hesitation.

During the Teaching Sample, he showed evidence for FA in ES because there was no overall activity, besides reading along, where the students participated in the lesson. Most candidates were called upon for strictly volunteered responses. For CD, the candidate receives FA because the objective was clearly stated, he broke down the definition of personification (even though it was slightly disjointed) and he gave an example as a Do Now where the students had to decipher which sentence used personification and why. The material provided supported his objective of figurative language in poetry however he did not clearly model which held him back from receiving an FA.

Group Activity: During the Group Activity, the candidate was able to incorporate multiple components of What to Do, an example of directions he delivered were ""Revised Direction: When I count to 3 every students needs to pick up their pencil and copy the definitions on the board, when you're down pens down and eyes on me to await further instruction."" He was also able to incorporate my feedback of making his directions more specific ""where are students writing their notes?""

In terms of CT she was rated FA+ due to an FA+ in the TSPF, GA and the reteach.

First, her TSPF was rated FA+.  She included clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  Her directions were step by step and included a student activity of students working on groups and determining the author's purpose,  She also included a logical check for student understanding using questions at the end of the lesson and the note card activity.  All of her key points are aligned to her objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.

Second, in terms of CT during the GA she was rated FA+.  She was able to appropriately participate in the planning for practice activity and followed all directions.  Also, she was able break down the WTD directions in a clear and logical manner.  Her initial proposed directions included concrete, sequential, and observable.  Her feedback to her partner, was specific, for example she stated to feedback to partner A, ""tell them silently when they get into groups, think of a more specific word for share, maybe explain,"" and to feedback to partner B, ""it should start off with getting their attention, like look at me, take out your nbs.""  These suggestion helped improve her partner’s directions.  Her revised directions accurately incorporated my feedback.  For example, I told her to make finding the heading more concrete.  In response she stated, ""located by the bold picture.""  Overall she demonstrated the ability to learn a new skill and apply that learning in a clear and logical manner.

Finally, in terms of the reteach she was rated FA+.  She accurately incorporated the WTD directions and my feedback into her reteach.  For example, my written grow was to tell the students what to do in their groups and she stated, ""Now I want you take 10 seconds to softly decide with your group the purpose of the text.""  This demonstrated a clear understanding of the feedback and the ability to interpret the information clearly.  Finally her WTD directions made sense in the context of her lesson and lead students toward successfully completing an academic task.  For example, she stated, ""in your right hand hold up the pink card if the purpose is to persuade, the white card if the purpose is to entertain.  Eyes on me as I read text 3,"" as examples of successful incorporating concrete, sequential, and observable directions.  Overall she was able to incorporate WTD directions in most parts of the lesson where appropriate.  

In terms of TP she was rated FA+.  She exhibited an ease, poise, and self-assurance with her interactions with the class.  She also demonstrated a confidence in her interactions.  She projected her voice and used both formal and informal tone depending on the part of the class.  In addition her tone was at an appropriate volume.  She maintained eye contact with the students and was always facing the class.  Finally, she spoke succinctly and clearly throughout the lesson and displayed instances of economy of language.

In terms of TS she was rated FA+ due to FA+ in ES and CD.

In terms of CD she was rated FA+.  Overall she facilitated understanding through her delivery.  First she clearly communicated the objective of the lesson to the students for example she read her objective off of her chart paper.  She used a model to clearly convey information for example she gave the students note cards with the 3 types of author's purpose to hold up during the text reading.  Also, she had a check of understanding by asking the students to hold up cards and share their responses.  Overall her lesson broke the content into smaller pieces and her presentation was clear and logical, this was a very well planned and executed lesson.  

In terms of ES she was rated FA+.  Her lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  She purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example she provided students with cards to hold up as she read, she asked questions about the content, and she asked students to agree or disagree with each other.    These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, she gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students answered questions, worked in groups, held up note cards, and read texts.   She also used the note cards as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example she had the students hold up the cards to test their knowledge of author's purpose.   During the lesson she cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall she intentional engaged all the students throughout her lesson.

Overall Dominique exceeds the bar for acceptance and is selected in.","Dominique spiked in a variety of areas, producing exceptional reviews from the selector. Nothing in her performance, past or present application, indicates that she should not move forward. Therefore, I agree with the selector to have Dominique be admitted into the program.

In terms of TS he was rated FA+ due to FA+ in CA, CD, and ES.

In terms of CA he was rated FA+.  Overall he presented a teaching sample that was in service to his stated learning objective. First, his interpretation of the objective was correct and the lesson addressed the objective in full for example identifying fact and opinion.  Second, he prioritized the content of and spent most of the time on what was most important for mastery of the objective. For example, students read sentences and determined if it was fact or opinion and explained why using his definition.   Third, he used materials, examples, and activities in service of the objective, for example his handout contained the definitions of the terms on each page and clear directions aligned to his key points.  Also, during the lesson he conveyed accurate content throughout the lesson.  Finally he demonstrated the ability to analyze and interpret information accurately as seen in his response to my question.  For example I asked why a certain sentence was opinion and he explained using his definition and turned in into a fact.

In terms of CD he was rated FA+.  Overall he facilitated understanding through his delivery.  First he clearly communicated the objective of the lesson to the students for example he stated the objective and it was on his handout.  He used a model to clearly convey information for example he used key words to help students identify fact or opinion.   Also, he had a check of understanding by asking the students to complete an exit ticket (number 3 on  his handout) and share their responses.  Overall his lesson broke the content into smaller pieces and his presentation was clear and logical, this was a very well planned and executed lesson.

In terms of ES he was rated FA+.  His lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  He purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example students read, answered questions, and shared their responses.  These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, he gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students could read, write and verbally respond.   He also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students complete an exit ticket once he realized there was a minute left.  During the lesson he cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall he intentional engaged all the students throughout his lesson.

In terms of CT he was rated FA with an FA+ in TSPF.  His TSPF was rated FA+.  He included clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  His directions were step by step and included a student activity of having students distinguish between fact and opinion.  He also included a logical check for student understanding using teacher questions and text based index cards.  All of his key points are aligned to his objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.

The TSPF is completed logically and appropriately with the key points logically and appropriately aligned to the objective.  Teacher and student actions are clearly listed in detail and include expected student answers.  The check for understanding is completely aligned to the chosen objective as teacher asks students to explain what parallel structure is, and to use it to complete a sentence. Eden began the lesson very confidently and attempted to be engaging.  She stated the lesson objective so that students are fully aware of the lesson objective for the day.  She uses a clear model that is clear to help convey what parallel structure is to students.  She does use check for understandings, and constantly asks students what the purpose of the parallelism is.  Therefore she is also asking students to support their findings.  Eden engaged each student at least once. She asked for students to volunteer answers, support their answers and gave students an opportunity to underline and identify parallelism in the model she provided them with.  Eden spent the entire lesson prioritizing the most important content and used materials and examples that were in service of the objective.  The first example required students to identify parallelism in a series of sentences.  The next example required students to fill in a blank to make sure the sentence is completed using parallel structure.  Eden maximized instructional time, as the lesson maintained a steady pace. She did make adjustments to ensure she had time to summarize.  During the group activity, Eden stayed on task and remained focus.  She incorporated all components of WTD during her initial revised directions and when she incorporated group member feedback.  She clearly incorporated selector feedback and maintained all components of WTD.  She gave feedback to group members using the feedback cheat sheet and even gave specific ways for her group members to improve their directions. During the re-teach, Eden used WTD to have students answer a question.

In the TSPF Edgar scored an E. All key points are aligned to the objective. Teacher action and student action are explained in detail to match the name of a triangle with a triangle. The lesson objective of matching triangles with names seems to facilitate mastery of the objective. The CFU causes students to demonstrate mastery.

In TP Edgar scored an FA+. He was confident through out the lesson and he maintained eye contact with his students the entire time. He also observed economy of language at some points.  In CA he scored an FA. He fully interpreted the objective and he prioritized content on what was most important in defining the different triangle types. However, in the beginning of the lesson he defined greater, less than and more which was a little extraneous. He conveyed accurate content the majority of the time except in one instance when he discussed the angles in a scalene triangle. In CD he scored an E. He asked numerous questions to clarify why the triangle was a type of triangle and he had students pair triangles with their name. The lesson objective was clear to students and he used materials that were used to support mastery of the objective. In ES he scored an FA+. All students matched triangles with the name and some raised their hand to answer questions. In MIT he scored an FA+. The lesson pace was steady and he spent most of the time on advancing student learning. Overall he scored an FA+ in the TS.

Throughout selection day, the candidate showed good communication skills with staff and other candidates. The candidate was professional to all and conducted all activities in a professional manner.

Overall the TSPF was FA. The candidate logically and appropriately completed the planning form about a lesson with author's purpose (persuade, inform, entertain). The candidate included in detail what the teacher and students would be doing throughout the lesson. The candidate planned lesson activities that involved a short sentences and a model that were logically aligned to the objective including questioning, an identifying activity, and a grouping activity.  There were multiple CFUs that addressed the lesson objective and content. The candidate included essential information for the lesson that aligned to the objective in the model and questioning. It is not clear if the candidate planned to use a text with the lesson.

TP - FA. The candidate was confident for the majority of the lesson and was engaging by asking questions and talking to students. The candidate projected his voice at an appropriate volume and was formal most of the time. The candidate made eye contact with students and does not turn his back to them. The candidate circulates and is always facing the class. The candidate did not demonstrate economy of language. 

CA - FA+. The candidate's interpretation of the objective is correct. He prioritizes important examples and prioritizes the content that is important for mastery of the objective. He uses activities that relate to the lesson objective and help students master the objective. The candidate's response to questions is accurate. 

CD - FA. The lesson objective was clearly stated to students and was explicitly said. The candidate presents information linearly and asks questions to engage students. The candidate used materials and questioning to support mastery of the objective. The candidate checks for understanding by asking students to apply the skill and assesses the objective. 

ES - E. The candidate purposefully engages all participants at least twice during the lesson including turn and talk, group work, sorting activity, and questioning. The candidate also provides all participants with different ways to participate (reading, kinesthetic, verbal). The candidate addressed all questions from the class when they arose.

MIT - FA. The lesson place is steady, but the candidate presented a rushed finish to the end of the lesson. The candidate does not refer to lesson notes. The candidate finished the lesson right at 5 minutes and most of the time was spent on activities, though the candidate used a lot of time to give directions multiple times. 
GA - FA+. The candidate stayed on topic in the pair. The candidate's original revised directions included two components of WTD. The candidate both gave glows and grows to his group members that helped them improve their instructions as well as received and implemented feedback that improved his directions. The candidate asked clarifying questions and incorporated feedback with accuracy from both group members and the interviewer.

Her lesson addressed the full objective and her content was accurate. Her lesson materials were logical and in service to the objective. The lesson objective was explicitly stated at the beginning of the lesson. She used a model to convey information. She checked for understanding by asking students to revise a sentence for parallel structure. She engaged all students more than once during the lesson by having students fill out guided notes, work in pairs to revise a sentence on a handout, and student volunteers to answer her questions. The lesson pace was steady, and most of the lesson time was spent on relevant activities. During the group activity, she included all four components of WTD, so her feedback from me was focused around a higher level skill. She provided feedback to group members that was actionable and improved the quality of their directions.

The teaching sample planning form is completed logically and appropriately.  There are three key points that are logically aligned to the chosen objective.  Teacher and student actions are outlined, however, not in any detail.  The check for understanding is in part aligned with the chosen objectives.  Students will explain why authors use figurative and literal language and then come up with their own examples.  Although this is partly aligned, the chosen objective states that students will be able to identity figurative and literal language in a text. Emily began the lesson confidently and remained that way throughout the lesson.  She used a variety of tones to engage her students. She maintained a formal register and held eye contact with students.  When asked the selector question, she answered succinctly and demonstrated economy of language to answer the question fully and correctly.  Emily's interpretation of the provided objective is mostly correct but does not address the objective fully.  The objective states that students will be able to use a text to determine the difference between literal and figurative language and determine the meaning of each.  Although students were able to determine the meaning of each and write down those definitions, no text was used.  Emily spent the majority of the lesson lecturing students and providing them with definitions of different types of figurative language.  Therefore the model used did not necessarily relate to the lesson objective fully.  Emily began to summarize with 5 seconds remaining, therefore the check for understanding was not done or seen. Students did not have an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding.  However, Emily did attempt to summarize the lesson and check for understanding. During the group activity, Emily remained on task and focused.  She utilized the feedback cheat sheet really well and gave feedback to her group members that would help them improved their WTD.  Each time she provided group members with a concrete example on what could be said differently to really improve the quality of their WTD.  Her initial WTD included all the components of WTD although adding a time limitation could have made the directions even more concrete.  When given selector feedback, she was asked to use economy of language since her WTD were strong and had all the components.  She incorporated selector feedback without difficulties. During the reteach Emily incorporated WTD in a way that partially moves students towards the completion of an academic task.  She directed, ""Silently and quickly pick up your pen and silently copy down the definition on the board, when you are finished, please put your pens on your desk.""  Although these directions did lack some of the concrete component, as there is no time limit. Overall Emily demonstrated her understanding of the skill. As a result, it is recommended that Emily be select-in.",,BA Psychology conferred 5/2012,#N/A

She began by stating the objective and the definition of the atom. She was clear, confident and used economy of language during her introduction. Then, she drew a diagram on the board to show the nucleus and outer orbit of an atom to show the subatomic particles. She lectured on the location and the charge. She wanted students to draw the atom but did not give clear directions. Some students started drawing the diagram. I asked her to clarify ""what do you want us to do first?"" and she then asked students to draw the nucleus first. Then, she had all students turn and talk to repeat the information she presented about the location and charge of each particle. The lesson finished about a minute early and she repeated most of the information again to fill the time. Ericka was confident, engaging and showed some economy of language early in the lesson, receiving an FA+ in TP. She engaged all students in a Turn and Talk, and some in guided notes but it was not clearly set up. She received an FA+ in ES.

In the practice, she attempted to incorporate feedback but basically just repeated her exact directions. She received an FA in the GA. In the re-teach, she showed some confusion about how to incorporate What to do by asking students to draw a diagram that was not clear. She asked students to show their charge which was somewhat more specific, but she did not incorporate other elements of what to do. She said in a moment, and then correct herself to say in a minute.

Her TS on literal vs. figurative language was strong in CA and CD, and weaker in ES and MIT. Her entire lesson was aligned with her obj (she defined literal and fig lang, provided 3 examples of each, and had some S identify sentences as literal or fig), and had no inaccuracies, so she was E in CA. She used multiple examples, had a CFU, and asked S to explain their answers, so she was FA+ in CD. In ES, she was FA because though many S answered Qs aloud, not all did so in an academic way, and there was no other way to participate in the lesson. In MIT, she was also FA because she rushed to finish and did not completely finish her worksheet. Overall, her TS was FA+

There are three key points that are clearly aligned with the chosen objective, although one of the key points is that students will create their own facts and opinions which is only partially aligned with the chosen objective, but may help to facilitate mastery of the objective.  There is a check for understanding that requires students to differentiate between fact and opinion as the teacher reads from a text.  Student and teacher actions are listed but lack detail. Eugenie began the lesson confidently and attempted to use a variety of tones to engage students.  Eugenie interpreted the chosen objective correctly in part.  She does address part of the objective by having students understand the difference between fact and opinion.  However, no text was used.  Students were supplied a worksheet that had statements listed on it, as a class students determined if the statements were facts or opinions.  Eugenie even required students to explain their thinking by asking, ""How do you know."" Towards the end of the lesson, she supplied students with images and asked that they create their own facts and opinions based on the images provided.  Which is a misinterpretation of about half the chosen objective.  She began the lesson by stating the objective, explicitly so that it is clear to students. However, there was no text used.  Students were never presented the opportunity to distinguish fact and opinion in an informational text.  Instead, Eugenie had students create their own facts and opinions.  Although in order to create facts and opinions, you need to know what they are, this is only a part of the chosen objective.  Eugenie engaged students in multiple ways.  Students volunteered responses to questions and did copy down definitions.  Students were also writing their own facts and opinions, as well as using their worksheets to determine if statements were facts or opinions. During the group activity, Eugenie remained focused and on task.  She struggled slightly giving feedback from the feedback cheat sheet.  When she did give feedback, it did not necessarily make her group members WTD stronger or better.  Her initial revised directions did incorporate all the components of WTD, demonstrating strength in understanding the skill.  As a high performing candidate the selector feedback was for her to utilize economy of language.  However, the feedback didn’t seem clear to Eugenie as she just restated the same directions.  Despite this, she demonstrated strength in understanding the skill but struggled with giving appropriate feedback.

In terms of CT she was rated E due to E rating in the GA and FA+ in the TSPF.

First, her TSPF was rated FA+.  She included clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  Her directions were step by step and included a student activity of having students classify types of triangles.  She also included a logical check for student understanding using verbal questions and a worksheet at the end of the lesson.  All of her key points are aligned to her objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.

Second, in terms of CT during the GA she was rated E.  She was able to appropriately participate in the planning for practice activity and followed all directions.  Also, she was able break down the WTD directions in a clear and logical manner.  Her initial proposed directions included concrete, sequential, and observable.  Her feedback to her partner, was specific, for example she stated to partner A, ""in the beginning get the students attention, you could say pencils down, eyes on me so you know they have your attention.  Add in a time frame, how long should it take to find.  How long should finding the heading take?"" and to partner B, ""ask the students to form in groups and then state take out homework, open it up, have them discuss.""  Both of these suggestions improved her partners directions to the point of revising them.  Her revised directions accurately incorporated my feedback.  For example, I told her to make copying from the board more concrete.  In response she stated, ""copy the definition with the word first and the definition underneath from the board.""  Overall she demonstrated the ability to learn a new skill and apply that learning in a clear and logical manner.

In terms of TS she was rated FA+ due to an FA+ in ES.  

In terms of ES she was rated FA+.  Her lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  She purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example she asked numerous questions about triangles and angle names to the students and she used a handout with 3 questions.  These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, she gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example she verbally asked questions and had students complete a handout in writing.   She also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students complete an exit ticket.   During the lesson she cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall she intentional engaged all the students throughout her lesson.

Overall Fiona exceeds the bar for acceptance and is selected in.

At the selection event, Fred presented as professional, prepared, and communicated clearly with peers and NYCTF staff. Fred asked questions, provided feedback, and participated fully in the activities. 

Overall the TSPF was FA-.  The candidate chose an objective on teaching the difference between figurative and literal language. The candidate outlined basic activities that reiterated the prompts, but did not go into detail on teaching points, what the candidate would be doing and what the students will be doing. The candidate does not include student practice and there is not CFU present in the TSPF. 

Overall, Fred's TS was rated FA+. Fred was confident for the entirety of the lesson and though he did not move from one spot, he engaged successfully with all members and was able to present his lesson clearly and succinctly. Fred used a CFU and was able to drive instruction forward. 
TP - FA+. The candidate was confident for the majority of the lesson, but his interactions were not engaging. the candidate projected his voice loudly enough for all students to hear and never turned his back to the students. The candidate made eye contact with the students and stood in one spot for the entirety of the lesson. The candidate spoke succinctly at the beginning, but lost economy of language when explaining terms and answering questions. 
CA - FA+. The candidate's interpretation of the objective was correct and the lesson addressed the full objective. He used examples, activities, and materials that are mostly logical and relevant. His examples aligned to the lesson objective. The candidate conveyed accurate content and corrected some student answers during the lesson. 
CD - FA. The lesson objective was mostly clear to students and was presented to them at the beginning of the lesson. The candidate used materials and examples to support mastery of the objective. The candidate attempted to CFU, and responded to an inaccurate answer when it was given. The candidate did not require students to support their answers with reasoning and instead gave the reasoning for them. 
ES - FA. The candidate purposefully engaged all students through cold calling and questioning. The candidate engaged students in a way that drove instruction forward by checking for understanding. The candidate only gave students one way to participate in the lesson (verbal). The candidate answered questions, but lost economy of language when doing so. 
MIT - FA. The lesson pace was generally steady, but the candidate presented a rushed finish at the end of the lesson. The candidate referred to lesson notes, but did not stop the lesson to do so. The candidate was not able to summarize at the end of the lesson. 

In his critical thinking activities, Fred participated fully. He gave off topic feedback not related to directions once, but still gave feedback to his partners that allowed them to improve their instructions. Fred implemented feedback into his directions and his reteach showing that the candidate is able to take feedback and implement it as well as that he has an understanding of the importance of WTD. 
GA - FA+. The candidate stayed on topic in his group for the majority of the group activity, understood and appropriately participated by giving people glows and grows. His initial proposed directions were observable and sequential. He revised his directions to make them more concrete and specific. He gave somewhat logical feedback for his partners, though he strayed off topic once. He incorporated feedback with accuracy. 
RT - FA+. The candidate accurately implemented WTD directions. His directions were sequential, specific, and observable. He also appropriately included a time limit to make his directions more concrete and was related to his feedback during the group activity. 

Overall, Fred is a select - in candidate due to his overall performance at selection day. ","QC TSO (FA+ overall but FA in ES and CD) Should be FA overall. 

Fred has four previous applications, three of which were never completely submitted. In his one submitted application, he was selected out due to HE - but this was in 2013. Since then, our selection model has improved and Fred made it through Prescreening and Phone Interview. He displayed some generalizations about low-income communities, but I believe he has met the model and has shown improvement since his last application. Therefore, accept.

She checked for understanding multiple times and asked students to provide evidence for their responses. She engaged all students more than once by having them work on a handout. She also used cold call and student volunteers to answer questions out loud. The lesson pace was steady and the majority of the lesson time was spent on activities important for student understanding. During the group activity she was able to give WTD directions that were concrete, observable and specific.

Greg was visibly nervous, however it did not interrupt the thread of instruction.  He maintained the same formal tone throughout the lesson which resulted in his presence being rated an FA.  His content was accurately aligned with his objective, as were his lesson activities.  The lesson objectives are explicitly stated at the bottom of the worksheet for students to see and know.  However, his model was verbally delivered and was not entirely clear.  Greg utilized cold call to get all students engaged and offered more than one way of engagement by having students write down responses and verbally share out responses.

He gave his colleagues feedback that wasn't absolutely  logical or would improve their WTD.  When the selector gave feedback, he redelivered his what to do directions without making any changes.

She communicated the material clearly and confidently, if not ever so slightly too quickly. However in general the speed in which she delivered did not hinder the ability for students to understand the lesson. she was able to speak succinctly and maintain eye contact. The reason for no FA+ is because she did not have a variation of tone. The candidate received a FA+ in ES because of her Cold Call strategy. All students spoke at least one in the lesson, there was no writing involved even though there was a worksheet for the students to complete. She also received an FA in CD because it was a very linear delivery although she did use guided notes in a very useful way. She worked through the FOIL method in chart paper but also assumed a lot of information in terms of what the students should know, for example: never explained what like terms are or why they had to do that step after doing the FOIL method. She just did it and stated that's what the students have to do. 

Group Activity: Candidate received an FA in Group Activity because she was able to incorporate multiple components of What to Do, sample directions she gave: ""Revised Direction: Stop what you're doing and look up, silently take out your history textbook, turn to p.2 titled is DOI, once you have found the p and title we will begin, thumbs up when you have found the page."" She also showed a lot of hesitation when incorporating my feedback of giving her directions with limited used of her notes. She stopped and started again at least 3 times. She did get through it however but she may have trouble being agile and recovering from moments that are not scripted come PST.

Re-Teach: Candidate recieved a FA- in Reteach. She only used about 35-40 seconds of her re-teach, leaving approximately 1:15 left in the re-teach. Here is a sample of the directions she provided: ""Stop what you're doing, and I'll pass out a worksheet. On this worksheet you will be writing notes. Use your pencils Also we will be doing a problem together on this poster, look up when you're ready to begin."" The only component she really utilizes is ""look up when you're done"" as an observable. Her attempt to incorporate WTD demonstrates hat she does not fully understand the techniques outside of the scenarios practiced during the Group Activity. She may have trouble incorporating techniques from TLAC into her lesson plans during PST. ",BE but more than 12 lib arts credits ,"Calc:

He spoke succinctly and there were instances of EOL as he advanced through the definitions and solving of his equation.  CA: FA He interpreted the objective correctly, but was missing the ""doing"" component of the lesson, but didn't allow time for students to calculate the formula.  He used examples and materials that were logical and the content he presented was accurate.  His response to my question was accurate as well.  CD: FA The objective was clear because Hao stated it and his presentation of the lesson was clear and in a linear way.  He asked questions to support mastery and there was an attempt at a CFU.  ES: E He had all students participate twice, as this participation was purposeful and helped advance the lesson forward.  Student participated by answering questions, solving an equation, chorally responding to questions about mass and velocity, and responding to the CFU questions.

He is FA+ across the TS and across GA. There is a slight professionalism concern - under the pressure of the group activity, he stated ""Jesus Christ"" two times, but he otherwise demonstrated EPTs and was open to feedback. His TP was confident, but not engaging. He had good eye contact, but the monotone delivery kept him in FA. His lesson about literal vs. figurative language addressed the full objective, and had accurate and logical examples for a FA+ in CA. In CD, he stated the objective clearly, gave models of literal and figurative sentences, and CFUd by asking some students to explain why they decided a sentence was literal or figurative. All students completed this worksheet, and some answered questions for a FA+ in ES. His TSPF CT was FA+ for being sufficiently logical and detailed. In the GA, aside from the above EPT concerns, he participated logically and appropriately.

He conveyed accurately content and he corrected himself the one time he made an error in his explanation of electrons. His worksheet was in service to the objective. He earned an FA in CD because he did check for understanding , but he did no model or ask students to apply the skill to support mastery. He earned an FA+ in ES because he purposefully engaged all students with the atom diagram labeling and also engaged most other students with questions. He earned an FA in MIT. He earned an FA+ for the TSO.

For CT, Jack earned and FA+ because he had three components of WTD in the original direction and he was able to apply my feedback of telling students what to do to show they are following along (using a finger on the text). He also earned an FA+ in the reteach because he incorporated WTD directions in two parts of his lesson to make sure students knew to take notes and how to take notes. He also did WTD when telling students how to complete the diagram. He gave more concrete directions for what labeling looked like so this moved instruction forward. Overall his CT was FA+. Jack should be admitted to the program because he met the selection day bar. ",,"prefers science but does not have enough credits

She has planned checks for understanding and clear teacher actions and student actions. She has independent work planned for the students and multiple ways to assess their understanding of the content. During her Teaching Sample, Jacquelyn maintained eye contact, confident body language, a formal and appropriately volumed tone, and spoke succinctly and clearly.  She asked students to activate their prior knowledge from the day before to connect to the lesson and communicated the objective to students. She asked students to read sentences on a handout and asked them to push their thinking by explaining why and how they got their answers.  When I and another student asked clarifying questions, she offered explanations that helped deepen understanding of the topic (one student asked about a sentence, ""the more money you have the more successful you are."" She pushed their thinking and helped them understand by asking how she defined success, and whether her definition of success would be the same as another person's).  She repeatedly said that the information that you find in textbooks are facts, which is not definitively accurate because history textbooks throughout history have provided misinformation that can be subjective depending on who is writing the textbook and their version of history, but for the purposes of an introductory lesson on Fact and  Opinion, she did an excellent job of making references to texts and resources that the students can recognize in their daily lives.  She gave them opportunities to engage with an independent work task and then come back together to discuss their answers and explain their thinking.
During her Group Activity, Jacqueline provided feedback that was instructive in moving her groupmates forward in their WTD directions.

Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.

Second, in terms of CT during the GA he was rated FA+.  He was able to appropriately participate in the planning for practice activity and followed all directions.  Also, he was able break down the WTD directions in a clear and logical manner.  His initial proposed directions included concrete, sequential, and observable.  His feedback to his partner, was specific, for example he stated, ""tell them to point to the title, you can name the title.""  This suggestion helped improve his partner’s directions.  His revised directions accurately incorporated my feedback.  For example, I told him to make copy from the board more concrete, tell students exactly what they should do.  In response he stated, ""when you begin coping lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.""  Overall he demonstrated the ability to learn a new skill and apply that learning in a clear and logical manner.
 
In terms of TP he was rated FA+.  He exhibited an ease, poise, and self-assurance with his interactions with the class.  He also demonstrated a confidence in his interactions.

In terms of TS he was rated FA+ due to E rating in CA and FA+ in ES, CD, and MIT.

In terms of CA he was rated E.  Overall he presented a teaching sample that was in service to his stated learning objective. First, his interpretation of the objective was correct and the lesson addressed the objective in full for example he stated the learning objective at the start and reviewed it at the end of the lesson.  Second, he prioritized the content of and spent all of the time on what was most important for mastery of the objective. For example, after he defined the terms he had students identify the terms in 2 stories.  Third, he used materials- his handout, examples-in his speech, and activities- having students read a story and identify literal and figurative in service of the objective.  Also, during the lesson he conveyed accurate content at all times.  Finally he demonstrated the ability to analyze and interpret information accurately. 

In terms of CD he was rated FA+.  Overall he facilitated understanding through his delivery.  First he clearly communicated the objective of the lesson to the students for example after he stated the definition students wrote it on their handout.   He used a model to clearly convey information for example he used a handout with 2 stories and asked students to underline figurative language.  Also, he had a check of understanding by asking the students to answer questions and share their responses.  Overall his lesson broke the content into smaller pieces and his presentation was clear and logical, this was a very well planned and executed lesson.

In terms of ES he was rated FA+.  His lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  He purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example he had students answer questions, identify literal and figurative in stories, read a story, write definitions, and respond to his questions.  These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, he gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example through reading, writing, and verbal answers.  He also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students underline figurative meaning in the story.  During the lesson he cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall he intentional engaged all the students throughout his lesson.

For sixth grade special education.  The TSPF is completed logically and appropriately.  The key points listed are clearly aligned to the chosen objective.  Teacher and student actions are listed and have detail, as there are teacher questions listed and scripted.  The check for understanding is partially aligned to the chosen objective. The check for understanding calls for students to only identity parts of the respiratory system while the objective is that students will be able to identify and describe the functions. Jennifer began the lesson confidently and remained that way throughout the duration of the lesson.  She attempted to use a variety of tones to be engaging and when asked a selector question, she exercised economy of language.  Jennifer answered the question succinctly and effectively. Jennifer's interpretation of the chosen objective was correct, but partial.  The lesson activities were also partially aligned.  Students identified parts of the respiratory system, but did not spend time determining the function of each of the parts.  Jennifer did spend the first two minutes of the lesson lecturing while students sat and listened.  She went through the six most important organs and their functions.  Students then used a worksheet to place the different organs in their respective places.  For the last activity, students were to piece together cut outs in order to design the respiratory system, which again only partially addresses the objective.  The materials and lesson activities were all effective in moving students towards mastery, but for only a portion of the objective.  During the first half of the lesson where Jennifer primarily lectured, there were moments lost for student engagement.  Not every student participated but she did utilize cold call and had a worksheet for students to fill in the blanks.  Towards the end of the lesson, every student participated when piecing together parts of the respiratory system.  Jennifer did not completely maximize instructional time, as there was no time for a summary.  The check for understanding was done but not clearly.  Jennifer circulated as groups pieced together the parts of the respiratory system to check and see if students understood.  The objective was stated vaguely at the start of the lesson, but was clear enough for students to understand.  She used a simple model of the respiratory system to demonstrate the parts and then cut out pieces to help convey the lesson content.  This worked well as students were understanding and were able to complete the lesson activities. During the group activity, Jennifer remained on task and focused.  Jennifer's initial proposed directions incorporated all components of WTD although not in the most clear or concise way.  She utilized the feedback cheat sheet accurately and without difficulties in order to give her group members feedback. She implemented group member feedback accurately and when she gave feedback tried to give examples that would improve group members WTD.  This was uneven as sometimes the feedback would improve the WTD and sometimes it would not. The selector feedback was incorporated accurately. During the reteach, Jennifer incorporated WTD with all four of its components correctly.  She directed, ""All eyes on me, silently fill in the blanks, take thirty seconds to do so. Place your eyes on me and give me a thumbs up when you're done."" This WTD moves students towards the completion of an academic task and therefore demonstrates her full understanding of the skill.

TP: FA+
During Jennifer's TS, she was consistently confident and attempted to be engaging by varying her tone. Her voice was appropriately loud and clear, and she was mostly consistent in facing the class, although she read off her notes from time to time. She was mostly succinct--although she occasionally lost economy of language, she recovered quickly from these moments and moved forward with her lesson. FA+
CA: FA+
She interpreted the objective of determining author's purpose correctly, and her lesson addressed the full objective. All content conveyed was accurate, including her response to the selector's question, and her text excerpts and questions were in service to the objective.
CD: FA+
The objective was explicitly stated, and she used oral examples as a model for each of the three author's purposes. Her CFU included having students apply the skill by identifying purpose in 2 texts and providing their own examples.
ES: FA
Most candidates were engaged at least once by responding to questions, and students were also asked to circle whether a text was informative, persuasive, or entertaining, although this did not necessarily lead to students actually engaging.
MIT: FA
The lesson pace was generally steady, although she had to cut part of an activity to finish on time and then slowed down slightly toward the end.

During the group activity, Jennifer participated actively and enthusiastically. Unfortunately, her initial proposed direction did not demonstrate an understanding of the technique (""I notcied you are not ready. Thumbs up if you need further directions""). She was somewhat confused about the feedback portion and needed directions repeated several times, although this may have been due to nerves. Her feedback to her partners was logical, though they did not necessarily improve the activity. She was able to incorporate feedback from the selector. FA-

During her TSRT, Jennifer incorporated some elements of WTD, although this was imperfect--she had different elements for different parts of the lesson (an observable for taking out the worksheet, concrete/specific for identifying author's purpose). FA

Overall, Jennifer was an enthusiastic participant with a solid teacher presence. However, there were moments of concern throughout the event, in particular with critical thinking. Her re-teach was imperfect, although she did have some elements of WTD, but her performance in the group activity was weak, leaving me in some doubt as to her understanding of the technique. (She also was confused about the directions.)

The TSPF is completed logically and appropriately and key points are aligned to the chosen objective. The CFU is logical and aligned and teacher and student actions are also explained. However, the TSPF lacks detail. Student practice in the form of group work is evident throughout. The TP in this lesson is FA+, as there were strengths in econ of language and the candidate attempted to be engaging in tone throughout. He also maintained eye contact with the class and used a formal tone. He was confident when teaching and didn't appear to be nervous at all. The objective asked students to draw an atom, and that was part of the candidates worksheet but he did not ask the students to actually draw one, so there is misalignment there. Most of the content is therefore misaligned- he asked students to complete a worksheet and then reviewed true/false questions from the worksheet. His response to my question was accurate, and there were no errors in what he was teaching. The content was not quite extraneous, he just didn't ask the right questions to get to the objective. His explanation was also slightly confusing to participants but logical for the content in that students could not make connections between what they were asked to do and the content taught- the worksheets were not aligned to the minilesson. CD, however, was a strength because the candidate shared the objective explicitly with students and the CFU asked students to apply info about atoms, but he did not use a model. There was significant questioning and materials were connected to content, and the CFU partially addressed the objective- but still, students did not have to draw an atom. Students worked together in a group to complete their worksheets in writing, and he called on students to share responses to the worksheet. There was also one choral response during the lesson and he asked for volunteers when introducing the objective. All questions were addressed. In MIT, the pace of the lesson was steady and the candidate did not refer to notes during the lesson. Most of the time was spent on content and student work and all activities were completed so MIT is FA+. Overall, there were a variety of strengths and weaknesses in the TS. During the GA, Jeremy was FA. While he was able to support his colleagues and participated in the activity correctly, his feedback was mostly positive and he did not incorporate my feedback to use fewer words accurately.

It was detailed and logically aligned. The CFU asks the students to apply the skill but the lesson activities do not facilitate mastery of the objective. During the teaching sample her TP was FA.  She spoke clearly throughout the lesson but there were long periods where she had her back to the class to fill in the chart.  During the teaching sample her TSO was FA+.  She stated the objective at the start of the lesson and had a student read it, to multiply binomials.  She defined all the terms at the start and modeled how to complete the work using the box method.  She then had all students engaged in a worksheet and had each of them share the work they did through cold call and through choral response. (ES E).  The worksheet served as her check, but her formal check at the end of the lesson was just to restate the method they used to complete the work (CD- FA+).  All the lesson activities were aligned and were in service to the objective.  She missed an E but cutting the independent work short, so the students would not show mastery using the materials.  Her MIT was FA.  She cut the work time short and started to wrap up the lesson at 3:45.   She ended the lesson at 4:15.  During the GA she struggled a little with WTD.  Her directions were not sequential and he concrete elements were off.  She also struggled to give any quality feedback, she agreed with most of the feedback and offered some glows.  She received coach feedback on the sequential elements, and she incorporated that feedback.  During the reteach she continued to struggle with WTD, she struggled with the feedback and the direction she added were imperfect, she only gathered their attention throughout WTD.  (FA).  Overall because of a strong TSO I recommend her to the program. ",,"psych degree expected 6/2017

The lesson plan lacks significant detail (e.g., ""we'll do an exercise""), although they do align to the objective. The CFU exists, although it is, again, lacking in detail. FA

TP: FA+
During his teaching sample, John was confident and engaging, with varied and professional tone and an appropriate volume. His tone was clear, and his voice was strong. However, he struggled with economy of language, repeating himself sometimes three times when he hit a main point.
CA: FA
The objective was interpreted correctly although only addressed in part (students did not have the chance to ""use parallel structure"" as indicated by the objective). Materials were in service to the objective and mostly logical. Content was accurate, although not completely clear.
CD: FA
The objective was mostly clear, and the content was presented linearly. There was a partial CFU when he asked 2 students to fix sentences on the board.
ES: FA-
John lectured for well over 3 minutes, and the selector had to call his name to get called on with a question.
MIT: FA
The pace was generally steady, and notes did not interfere with the lesson.
TSO: FA

During the group activity, John's initial proposed direction was sequential, observable, and concrete. He participated actively in the discussion and gave glows and grows to his partners, although they did not necessarily move their directions to be stronger WTD directions, and once, he only gave positive feedback despite prompting. During practice, his directions incorporated all elements of WTD. He incorporated selector feedback with accuracy. FA+

During his TSRT, John's WTD direction was observable and concrete, although not necessarily moving students toward an academic task. He used the obserable component after each direction, making his directions excessively wordy. FA 

CT overall: FA+

With a particularly strong teacher presence and spikes in TP and CT, John is a select in. However, there were some moments of concern (e.g., using up his entire two minutes during the group activity to give directions about his directions, his phone rang twice, he stayed behind after the event asking how he could contact me). I think he will require significant coaching support and may be a challenging coachee but he is a select in according to the model.",,"prefers english but does not have degree

It was planned logically and completely and key points were aligned and explained in detail.  His activity included clear instructions for what students would be doing during the class. Check for understanding is clear and addresses the lesson objective and content. The only weakness is that his opening activity is not as relevant to the task, although it is logical. The TS was FA. His TP was FA because he was confident and made eye contact with all of the students, except he briefly, turned his body to the class.  Economy of language is a weakness. He often uses words like ""ummm"" while explaining the content, however, when he was answering questions from the candidates and selector, he did not pause. CA was also a weakness, most of the activities were aligned, but he conveyed an inaccuracy about the difference between metamorphic and igneous rocks in addition to misspelling igneous on the board. He also affirm a misconception about the properties of igneous rocks when a student stated that they were all smooth. He had a strength in CD by asking students to apply a skill and in his CFUs he called on all students. ES was rated at FA+, because he provided students with a turn and talk and cold call engagement and students were asked to verbally and in written form respond to his prompts. During GA, he received a FA+ because the directions to grow were clear and provided evidence for his peers, as a result peers were able to construct much better WTD directions. In his initial directions, he included all four components of WTD and in the revision was able to incorporate all feedback, including my feedback to deliver his directions at a slower pace. John's reteach was a strength and he received an E in his RT. He used a variety of observables including ""eyes on me"", ""put one finger up"" and ""hold pencil in the air"" he was also concrete in his WTD by giving students concrete options such as silently and concrete time frames.  Overall, John is a good candidate who should be accepted into NYCTF. He met or exceeded the model in parts of the interview.

When I asked a question she did get flustered. Asked: If I believe that roses are the best smelling flower why isn't a fact? (she had not defined the terms). She did pause when answering. Voice volume and tone were all appropriate. ES is FA+ because all students were engaged at least once when she instructed the class to complete the first 3 questions on her worksheet. Her CD is FA- because the sequencing of her lesson was illogical. She started asking the class what were facts and opinions before she even told them what those words meant.

Group Activity: Jokasta was able to participate in the GA and was able to demonstrate some strengths that didn't necessarily come to play during her TSO. She was able to deliver clear WTD, with multiple components. She was able to provide feedback that was helpful, not as much as the other stronger personalities however she showed that she could provide and receive feedback. 

Re-Teach: Jokasta, though a bit stilted in her delivery because it was one WTD after another, after another, clearly knew that she had to use WTD for multiple steps in her lesson plan. She used it when they had to take out their worksheet, to write their name and the date (even though this direction probably could have been combined), and when the students were going into an independent and academic activity. She incorporated time (20 seconds) making it concrete and clear observables.

Though Jokasta could work on her TP and her CD, her CTO showed that she should be able to successfully complete the PST program. She took feedback and was clearly able to demonstrate her understanding of hte techinque in her reteach. ",,3.34,#N/A

He prioritized teh content and spent the time focused on student mastery of the objective and used examples, activities, and materials that were in service of the objective.  He conveyed accurated information throughout. CD: FA+ He stated the objective, which made it clear to students and used two models to help convey the information.  He checked for understanding by having his students apply the skill and they supported their responses with a rationale.  ES: FA+ He was purposeful in his engagement of students, having them read, write, underline, answer questions, and used cold calling.  Through this engagement, he was able to get his students to perform an academic task.  MIT: FA+ His pacing was steady and he finished the lesson, but it was a slightly rushed because of the one-minute warning.  He spent the entire time on the execution of the lesson.  GA CT: FA During the activity, Jonathan was able to develop incomplete WTD instruction that incorporated 2/4 components of the skill.

He maintained eye contact, however when he modeled his lesson his back was turned for longer than 15 seconds at a time. He spoke succinctly and had a formal tone throughout the lesson. He maintained economy of language. He did not earn an FA+ because there was no variation of tone to engage the students. Joseph earned an FA- in TSO because he received an FA- in ES as well as CA. He really only allowed for one way for students to participate in the lesson, letting the same 2-3 students answer his call and response questions. There was no writing or reading that the students had to do, so since not everyone participated at least once he received an FA-. He received an FA- in Content Alignment because his model  was confusing in terms of how to find the area of a triangle. He somehow dissected a circle and turned it into a rectangle but did not do a good job of explaining how you turn a circle into a rectangle He eventually got to the point where he found the area but how he got from Point A to Point B was unclear. 

Group Activity: Candidate was by far the strongest in this activity from the group. He was able to incorporate all 4 components and give actionable feedback to the Fellow candidates so that they were able to improve their directions, like telling a candidate to be more specific about where the students should start reading.  

Re-Teach: Joseph received an FA in his Re-Teach because he didn't apply  WTD directions in multiple parts of his re-teach. His direction also did not lead them to complete an academic activity, as the direction was simply to take out their worksheets and follow along. He did incorporate two components of WTD, however they were slightly imperfect as it was a poor choice of the ""concrete"" domain and no clear observable directions. 

Please review: Joseph seemed to know his content well, despite the fact that he presented it in a confusing way and his GA and CT skills were by far the best of the day.

During the TS, Judith's TP was FA. She projected a little nervousness, but it didn't interfere with her lesson. She made consistent contact with the students, and she spoke clearly, but didn't always use economy of language. CA is FA+. She addressed the full objective, and spent the time on what was important for mastery of the objective. She used materials that were in service of the objective. CD is FA. The candidate did state the objective at the beginning of the lesson, and she did use a model to convey the food chain. She attempted to check for understanding, but ran out of time to do so. ES is FA-. She only cold called on a few students, and she lectured for almost the entire lesson. MIT is FA-. Judith ran out of time, and didn't have time for students to complete the CFU on the worksheet. The GA is FA. During the GA, Judith's directions incorporated three of the WTD elements, but her feedback to her colleagues was generally only positive, and she didn't fully incorporate the feedback. The RT is FA. During the RT, Judith incorporated several instances of WTD directions, but they didn't move the students toward completing an academic task. Judith is select out bc of an FA- overall in the TS. ","Accepting this candidate because of Jen's Please Review flag. Jen wants to make sure we do not double-ding her for not getting to the final CFU in her lesson. As we advise that a ""significant part of the lesson"" in MIT is student practice, I think not getting to her final CFU questions is not too significant a part and therefore, I don't want to double-up the FA- and penalize her twice for not getting to that final check. It seems she did ask for volunteers throughout the lesson as well, engaging most students once. Therefore, changing her ES rating to FA and subsequent TSO rating to FA. She is accepted.

The TSPF is completed logically and appropriately.  There are three key points listed that are aligned to the objective and help to facilitate mastery and understanding of the objective.  Teacher questions are clearly scripted, however, student actions and anticipated student responses lack detail.  The check for understanding is clearly and logically aligned to the chosen objective. Kaadiana began the lesson with a very strong teacher presence.  She used a variety of tones to engage students.  She maintained a formal register and eye contact throughout the lesson. When asked a selector question, she responded utilizing economy of language and spoke clearly and succinctly.  The way Kaadiana interpreted the chosen objective was partially correct. The objective states that students will be able to determine author’s purpose in a selected text.  Although she did not use a text exactly, she used song lyrics.  However, Kaadiana asked students to identify all three of an author’s purpose within that one piece of text.  The worksheet in which students used to follow along with the lyrics states that they are to underline and highlight any key points that show the authors purpose, but this was not explicitly stated and students did not do this.  The objective was clearly stated at the beginning of the lesson and written on the board for students.  Kaadiana attempted to present the information clearly, however, asking students to identify evidence that makes the song lyrics fall into all three categories of authors purpose may not have been clear to all students. Kaadiana used the one text (song lyrics) and attempted to have students explain that the authors purpose was to persuade, entertain and inform all at the same time.  Again, though this may be applicable, it was not clear to students, as only two students were able to provide responses when it was time to share out. Kaadiana engaged all students at least one throughout the lesson.  She took volunteers as well as cold called students for answers.  Even though the worksheet directed students to highlight and underline evidence, she did not direct students to do so.  Aside from answering questions in a call and response style, there were no other methods of engagement. With twenty seconds remaining in the lesson, Kaadiana began to summarize by asking students what the three different authors purpose was.  Despite this, students never really had an opportunity to use a text to clearly determine if an author's purpose was to persuade, inform or entertain.  However, students did clearly understand the differences between each of the author's purpose and what they mean. During the group activity, Kaadiana remained on task and was focused.  Her initial revised directions included all components of WTD but minimally.  When giving feedback, she used the feedback cheat sheet to give her group members feedback that would help to improve their WTD.  At times, she gave specific examples of what group members could say to improve their WTD.  When given selector feedback to pause between sequential directions, she was able to implement the feedback without difficulty. During the reteach, Kaadiana attempted to implement WTD for an activity that moved students towards the completion of an academic task.  However, her WTD did not include all four components.  She directed, ""Now look at your second worksheet, as you listen to the song, I want you to jot down key points that let you know if the authors purpose is to inform, persuade or entertain.""  Even though these WTD contain two components, they are not concrete or observable.  Although Kaadiana demonstrated strength during the group activity, it did not translate to the reteach.

He also included a logical check for student understanding using the handout and his questions at the end.  All of his key points are aligned to his objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.

Finally, in terms of the reteach she was rated FA+.  She accurately incorporated the WTD directions and my feedback into her reteach.  For example, my written grow was to tell the students what to do while they read the poem and she stated, ""while you are reading please keep in mind fact and opinion, when you are finished reading the paragraph pens down and look up at me.""  This demonstrated a clear understanding of the feedback and the ability to interpret the information clearly.  Finally her WTD directions made sense in the context of her lesson and lead students toward successfully completing an academic task.  For example, she stated ""all eyes on me, silently turn the paper over, now take your index finger and place it on the picture of the sting ray, take 10 seconds to silently read the paragraph,"" as examples of successful incorporating concrete, sequential, and observable directions.  Overall she was able to incorporate WTD directions in most parts of the lesson where appropriate.  


In terms of TP she was rated FA+.  She exhibited an ease, poise, and self-assurance with her interactions with the class.  She also demonstrated a confidence in her interactions.  She projected her voice and used both formal and informal tone depending on the part of the class.  In addition her tone was at an appropriate volume.  She maintained eye contact with the students and was always facing the class.  Finally, she spoke succinctly and clearly throughout the lesson and displayed instances of economy of language.

In terms of TS she was rated FA+ due to FA+ in ES and CD.  FIX

In terms of CD she was rated FA+.  Overall she facilitated understanding through her delivery.  First she clearly communicated the objective of the lesson to the students for example she stated her objective and provided an example.  She used a model to clearly convey information for example, she used the definition to frame identifying fact or opinion.   Also, she had a check of understanding by asking the students to complete a question on her handout.  Overall her lesson broke the content into smaller pieces and her presentation was clear and logical, this was a very well planned and executed lesson.
 
In terms of ES she was rated FA+.  Her lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  She purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example she had students read aloud, answer questions, and share responses.  These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, she gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students read, wrote, circles, and answered questions verbally.  She also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students circle fact or opinion on their sheet.  During the lesson she cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall she intentional engaged all the students throughout her lesson.

For example, I told her to make finding the D of I more concrete.  In response she stated, ""find the heading D of I that is at the bottom of the page next to the picture of GW.""  Overall she demonstrated the ability to learn a new skill and apply that learning in a clear and logical manner.
 
In terms of the TS there was conflicting, FA- and FA+ evidence with an overall FA rating.
In terms of TS she was rated FA due to FA+ in CD and ES and FA- in CA.

In terms of CA she was rated FA-.  Overall she presented a teaching sample not in service to the stated learning objective.  First, her interpretation of the objective was mostly correct but did address the objective in full.  For example, she asked students to identify figurative and literal language in a passage but then in the share she asked what type of figurative language it was (hyperbole, metaphor).  Also, she included minor pieces of extraneous content which distracted from the lesson.  For example, she never defined hyperbole and metaphor but she asked students to identify it.  In addition she used materials, activities, and examples that were slightly confusing to the students for example, asking students to identify figurative in the reading but then verbally asking them what type of figurative language that was.  
 
In terms of CD she was rated FA+.  Overall she facilitated understanding through her delivery.  First she clearly communicated the objective of the lesson to the students for example, she stated the learning objective and provided examples of literal and figurative language.  She used a model to clearly convey information for example, students underlined examples of figurative and literal in their poems after she modeled for them.  Also, she had a check of understanding by asking the students to complete a poem on their own and had them share their responses.  Overall her lesson broke the content into smaller pieces and her presentation was clear and logical, this was a very well planned and executed lesson.

In terms of ES she was rated FA+.  Her lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  She purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example she asked questions about content, asked students to identify literal or figurative language, read aloud a poem, and work independently on a poem.  These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, she gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students could read, listen, respond verbally, write, and share their responses during the lesson.  She also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students complete a poem on their own after she modeled a poem with them.  During the lesson she cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall she intentional engaged all the students throughout her lesson.

Overall Kara exceeds the bar and is selected in.

Karen scored a FA in TP. She seemed confidant but her interactions were not engaging as she did not interact with students. She spoke very clearly and maintained a formal tone. Karen scored a FA in CA because she did address the full objective which was ""identify the parts and steps of human respiration."" Karen labeled all parts of the respiratory system but was unable to explain any steps during the process. However, she conveyed correct content when labeling her model. Karen was a FA in CD because she had a model of the respiratory system and attempted to check for understanding. However, during her check for understanding, Karen pointed to the correct answer before asking the question and was only able to ask 1 student a question without providing an answer. Lastly, she was a FA in ES because she engaged all participants by having them label their worksheet. However, when she cold called students she told them the answer so she did not push academic thinking for students. Lastly, Karen was a FA in MIT because he pace was steady. Karen took close to 2 minutes to set up her poster and finished the lesson a few minutes early. During the group activity (FA+), Karen provided a glow and a grow for her partner's and included three components of WTD directions. She could have made her direction more specific. She also stayed on topic in the pair. During the reteach (FA), Karen delivered one WTD direction and then missed several opportunities to say a WTD (labeling the rest of the model). Through the interview, Karen was professional and had clear communication skills. 

I recommend Karen for NYCTF, due to her CTO rating. ","No concerns, she met the model this year. She applied last year and was admitted to the MY cohort, but didn't enroll.","criminal justice degree conferred 2/2007

In terms of CT she was rated FA+ due to an FA+ in GA and the reteach.

In terms of CT during the GA she was rated FA+.  She was able to appropriately participate in the planning for practice activity and followed all directions.  Also, she was able break down the WTD directions in a clear and logical manner.  Her initial proposed directions included concrete, sequential, and observable.  Her feedback to her partner, was specific, for example she stated, ""Pencils up when ready to copy the definitions from the board,"" would make sense in terms of a logical observable directions to help them start copying.  This suggestion helped improve her partner’s directions.  Her revised directions accurately incorporated my feedback.  For example, I told her to make finding the title more concrete, tell students exactly what to do to complete the task .  In response she stated, ""point to the title that is underlined at the top of the page...""  Overall she demonstrated the ability to learn a new skill and apply that learning in a clear and logical manner.

Second, in terms of the reteach she was rated FA+.  She accurately incorporated the WTD directions and my feedback into her reteach.  For example, my written grow was to tell the students how to complete the handout and she stated, ""pick up your pencil and point to the first blank space on the bottom left.  Once you have found it thumbs up.  Copy the information from the board exactly as I write on on your sheet.""  This demonstrated a clear understanding of the feedback and the ability to interpret the information clearly.  Finally her WTD directions made sense in the context of her lesson and lead students toward successfully completing an academic task.  For example, she stated ""If you are ready thumbs up.  In the next blank space write rising action.  When you have copied all that information from the board heads up and make eye contact with me,"" as examples of successful incorporating concrete, sequential, and observable directions.  Overall she was able to incorporate WTD directions in most parts of the lesson where appropriate.  

Her TSPF was rated FA.  She included mostly clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  Her directions were step by step and included a student activity of students arranging the plot points of a story.  She also included a logical check for student understanding using a recap at the end.  Most of her key points are aligned to her objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained and were relevant to the learning objective.

In terms of TS she was rated FA with an FA- in MIT.

In terms of MIT she was rated FA- due to a lesson pace that was mis-allocated on activities.  For example, she spent the first 2 minutes defining the 5 stages of story plot then had the students work on a handout for almost one minute and thirty seconds where there was no instruction or teacher actions.  Hence she finished the lesson rushed as she tried to share the responses in the last minute.

For CA, Kevin's interpretation of the objective is correct and he addresses the full objective. He used examples and materials that were in service to the chosen objective.

He received a E in ES because he had all students participate at least twice: a choral reading of the definitions of fact and opinion, as well as all students answer questions on a worksheet. He received a FA in CD because although  he was engaging in this TP and ES, his CD was still fairly linear. Definitions, model, examples, student practice. 

Group Activity: Kevin was strong in the GA. He was able to deliver directions that had at least 3 components of WTD, making his directions sequential observable and specific. He was also able to provide feedback each round of the candidate that was both positive and negative. Even when he stated that he thought the directions sounded good, he still attempted, and was able to build off of other people's feedback. 

Re-Teach: Re-Teach was not as strong as the Group Activity, which may show that he may have some trouble incorporating techniques into the LP. Directions were very vague, like ""carefully listen"" or ""take a few minutes"". Even though he did not get to finish his last directions, it was clear that he was transitioning to an academic activity. He also tried to incorporate my feedback because I told him to use the directions to transition to a group or independent activity. 

Overall Kevin seems like an eager candidate based on his  TSO and CTO. I do question how he'll deal with more rigorous content, instead of giving a fairly simple lesson on the American Flag. However, rigor of the content is not being assessed so overall he is a strong candidate. ",,"missing 2 science credits but still eligible for D75

She received an FA+ in ES because she was able to engage all students at least once when all the students had to identify what was persuasive, informative, or entertainment on their own. Other participation came through student volunteers and did not get to everyone. She also received a FA+ in CD because the objective was clear and her checks for understanding required student to back up their answer with evidence by asking ""how do we know it is informative?"" She was able to complete her mini lesson, independent practice, and wrap-up in the 5 minutes without being rushed which is why she received an E in MIT. She received an FA in CA because the objective specially called for informative and persuasive author purpose, and she spent unnecessary time on entertainment.

Group Activity: Kim received an E in group activity because she showed a lot of initiative in giving feedback, especailly to Nathan while giving clear grows and glows that were based on the cheat sheet.

Kristina earned an FA on her TSPF. The key points and activities were aligned to the objective. In pairs/groups, there is a CFU in which students determine if a sentence contains literal or figurative language, however, the TSPF does not include a CFU at the closing of the lesson. 

Kristina earned an E on her TS. Kristina's TP was FA+ because she projected her voice, maintained eye contact with students and demonstrated confidence in interacting with the class. She lost economy of language when answering questions, which kept her out of E. With respect to CA, Kristina was also FA+. She conveyed accurate content at all times and all activities and questions were in service to the objective. Since Kristina's TS lacked independent practice, the lesson was unable to gauge individual student mastery. In terms of ES, Kristina was FA+. She engaged all students once by having them work with a partner to determine whether a sentence contained figurative or literal language. She also cold called students and took volunteers, which allowed most students another opportunity to participate. In terms of CD, Kristina used a model to demonstrate the differences between literal and figurative language, asked students to explain the examples she provided and stated the objective clearly at the beginning of her TS. As a CFU, students were asked to determine whether a sentence contained figurative or literal language and when they shared answers at the closing of the lesson, she asked students to justify their answers. She was therefore E in CD.

During the GA, Kristina's initial WTD directions incorporated 3 components of WTD. She was able to give feedback that helped improve her partner's directions and accurately incorporated feedback from staff. 

In the TSRT, Kristina was FA. She attempted to incorporate WTD at two points in her lesson, but the attempts were imperfect and did not demonstrate a clear understanding of the technique. ","Candidate withdrew previously due to program timing and personal conflicts.

For TP, Lawrence scored an FA. He was confident throughout the lesson and projected his voice but had a slightly informal tone.  He maintained eye contact with students and had an economy of language most times while teaching. At one point in the lesson, Lawrence broke character, and stated “Minus 7 points for me, because I don’t have an extra copy of my worksheet.”  For ES, Lawrence scored an FA. He engaged students all once by asking them to solve a 2 step equation on their worksheet and then engage some students again, by cold call and verbal response while modeling how to solve the equations. For CA, Lawrence scored an FA+. He addresses the full objective and prioritized content – the steps needed to solve a 2 step equation – for student mastery of the objective. He also used several examples and a worksheet to teach information. For CD, Lawrence scored an FA+. He clearly stated the objective at the beginning of the lesson and used 2 models to teach 2 step equation. He checked for understanding by asking student to apply their knowledge with a new equation and by having a student walk through how to solve the equation on the board for the class. For MIT, Lawrence scored an FA+. He lesson pace was steady and he adjusted the independent work to be able to reach the conclusion of his lesson. He spent the bulk of his lesson time on the most important part, allowing students to practice solving many equations. For the Group Activity, Lawrence scored an FA. He was able to create a WTD direction with at least 2 components although it was slightly illogical. He was able to give feedback to his partners to improve their directions to be more concrete and specific by suggestion helpful language. However Lawrence struggled to incorporate my feedback to add a time frame to his directions and needed to ask clarifying questions and restart his delivery. For the Re-Teach, Lawrence scored an FA-. He demonstrated that he didn’t fully understand how to use WTD directions to drive the lesson forward. He started to deliver directions and then began to teach in the middle of it. He was miss clear observable and sequential steps to his directions. Lawrence scored an overall CT score of FA.  Some professionalism issues came up during the event that did not fall into the rubric. Lawrence brought a projector for his teaching sample, while teaching he broke character to make a joke.

She made eye contact, even though at the beginning of the lesson her back was facing the class for 15 seconds because she was finishing a chart on the board from the 1 minute set up. The candidate needs to work on her economy of language as well. She received a FA+ in ES because all students were engaged at least once when she had everyone write in a graphic organizer: what what was the fact in the paragraph, why was it a fact? then the same line of questioning for the opinion. She received an FA- in CA. The activities were mostly aligned however she repeatedly stated an inaccurate detail that would eventually lead to  inaccuracies in the student work. She stated the ""doctor stating that the panda is fine"" is a fact because a doctor said it. However, even though a doctor is qualified to make an assessment, it is an expert's opinion, not a fact. 
Group Activity: Magdalene was able to make her directions very sequential, specific and concrete. However, economy of language is still an issue for her. Even after I gave her the feedback of saying her directions in less words, her directions were entirely too wordy. She also said them in a speed that was too fast for me to write down fully. I tried to pick up what i could, but I know she incorporated at least 3 components. 

Re-Teach: The re-teach incorporated observable: paper in the air, observable: pencils down eyes on me; and specific and concrete: silently read paragraph, circle the fact and write it down in your graphic organizer. 

Candidate is Select In because she is FA inTSO because of her ES is FA+ but her CA is FA-. She is also FA+ in CTO, even though she was not as strong in her GA. Overall this candidate will have to work on her TP because of the speed in which she talks and her economy of language and making sure that the information she is conveying is accurate.

Maimoona was E for CA; her content aligned with her objective and she corrected all responses and presented fully correct information.  Her material and examples were also in service to her objective.  She was FA for CD; the objective was clearly stated and she used a model to teach.  She also checked for understanding to call on S to help solve a second problem, but S were never responsible for completing problem on own.  Maimoona was FA+ for ES; she gave all S two ways to participate - writing def of radius copied from board (not really driving instruction) and all S orally responding to Qs (driving instruction).

Maimoona was FA+ for GACT; she gave feedback to some of her groupmates that helped to improve their WTD directions and her initial revised direction included all four components of WTD.  Maimoona was FA+ for ReteachCT; she included multiple examples of complete WTD directions in her reteach based on my FB.

The candidate was very clear with communication throughout selection day and was professional, polite, and responsive to selectors and other candidates. The candidate is overall Select-In.
Overall the TSPF was FA+. The candidate prepared a lesson on solving 2 step equations for the value of an unknown variable. The candidate outlined key points for students to apply the opposite operations and an option for them to check their answer. The candidate detailed the questions, student responses for each step of the model problems. The teacher put many student actions in the teacher outline box, though the form was still completed logically and completely. The teacher outlined a practice problem for the end that serves as a CFU. The activities are logically aligned to the objective and the CFU addresses the objective. The lesson includes appropriate key points, vocabulary, and essential information.
TP - FA+. The candidate is confident for the majority of the lesson and is engaging through a variation of tone. The candidate circulates around the room and projects her voice so that all students can hear. The candidate uses a formal tone and maintains eye contact with students even when she is writing on the board. The candidate speaks succinctly and is not rushed. Teh candidate does not pause when answering questions. 
CA - E. The candidate's interpretation of the provided objective is correct and the lesson addresses the objective in full. the candidate prioritizes the content, vocabulary, and steps that are necessary for mastery of the objective. The candidate provided an example, graphic organizer, anchor chart, and materials that help lead students to understanding. The candidate conveys accurate information at all times. 
CD - FA+. The lesson objective was clear to students because it was written and explicitly stated. The candidate used a graphic organizer, model, and anchor chart to clearly model information. The candidate checks for understanding by using questioning and having students solve a problem. 
ES - E. The candidate purposefully engages students at least once in the lesson through writing, cold call, and questioning (volunteer). The candidate uses these in a way that pushes academic thinking and leads students towards mastery of the objective. The candidate addresses all questions from the class when they arise and allowed it to clarify her lesson in the future. 
MIT - FA+. The candidates lesson pace was steady, though presented a rushed finish. Most of the time is spent on the most important activities to address student understanding.
GA - FA. The candidate stayed on topic in the group. The candidate appropriately participated in the activity and followed directions. The candidate's initial proposed directions were sequential and specific. The candidate only gave positive feedback during the activity. 
RT - FA. The candidate attempts to incorporate WTD during their reteach is imperfect given the context, though she incorporates specific and concrete steps for students. The candidates WTD are clear and help move students forward through the example problem, but not towards completing an academic task. The candidate did not incorporate WTD for the independent practice portion of the lesson that was critical and where WTD should have been delivered.

Mariam began the lesson confidently and remained this way throughout the lesson.  She attempted to use a variety of tones to be engaging and used economy of language when asked a question by the selector.  Her response was succinctly and clearly given in a way to help promote student understanding.  Mariam clearly stated the lesson objective at the start of the lesson so it was clear to students.  Use used a large model to convey the lesson information.  She had the definitions of main idea and supporting detail written out clearly on a poster, along with the first example on their worksheets written out on large poster board for students to see.  Mariam used the second excerpt of the text as a check for understanding, as she had students complete it individually and then share out their responses.  Mariam would either affirm correct answers or refute wrong answers and explain why.  However, she did not allow or present students with the opportunity to justify and support their responses.

Marsha's TSO earned an FA. In TP, she earned an FA+. She was confident consistently throughout the lesson and maintained a formal tone and volume. She maintained eye contact with students when she asked CFUs. She did use economy of language at certain aspects, but at times she used extraneous details, specifically when she was explaining what students were going to do with the text and worksheet. In CA, Marsha earned an FA. Her interpretation of the object-- distinguishing between fact an opinion in an informational text was correct and her lesson was correct, but her activities present some inaccuracies. In CD, Marsha earned an FA. She did not use a clear model of fact and opinion. She simply jumped into her activity of the Martin Luther King reading and relied on prior knowledge ""from yesterday's lesson."" She starts the lesson clarifying the objective to student and she does CFU at times, asking students if certain statements were a fact or opinion. However, she often provided the evidence for them. In MIT, Marsha earned a FA+. Her pace was steady, but she adjusted her final activity after a one minute call to make sure she got through all of her questions on the worksheet. In ES, Marsha earned a FA+, she had students work on two questions independently, as a written activity, and accepted choral response and call-and-response for her questions. She also cold called two students to identify whether a sentence was a fact or opinion. 

Overall in CT, Marsha earned an FA. In the GA, Marsha earned an FA+. She gave strong feedback to all of her peers that would improve their directions. Her initial proposed directions only included the specific and observable directions to WTD, but with my feedback she included a concrete direction. In her RT, Marsha earned an FA-.

Her directions were very clear and the candidate gave logical feedback to her team members during the planning for practice that improved her partner's directions. 

RT - E. The candidate accurately incorporates WTD so effectively that it drives their lesson forward and demonstrates a deep understanding of WTD. She used WTD to have students complete an academic task and share their answers, explaining their thinking in order to drive instruction forward and help show mastery in the lesson.

Melissa's TSPF was an FA. Melissa planned a lesson around a misinterpretation of the objective, ""distinguish between literal and figurative language."" With respect to figurative language, Melissa narrowed the focus of her lesson to simile only. As a result, her closing CFU is misaligned. Despite this, most key points are aligned to the objective and planned activities are logical. 

Melissa's overall TS was FA+ due to a strength in CD. She projected her voice and was confident for most of the lessons. However, she did not demonstrate economy of language especially in answering questions. Melissa's CA was FA due to the misinterpretation of the objective previously mentioned. As a result, the activities, questions and key points were mostly logical and relevant to the objective, but not entirely so. With respect to CD, Melissa was FA+ because she used a model to convey the difference between literal and figurative language, clearly stated the lesson objective at the beginning and CFU by asking students to find examples of similes and literal language and explain their meaning. In terms of ES, Melissa was FA because she did not engage all students in an academic task at any point in her TS. However, she did allow most students to participate verbally.

During the GA, Melissa's initial directions met multiple components of WTD. Melissa was able to give feedback to her peers that helped improve their directions. As an example, Melissa determined that her partner had misunderstood her assigned scenario and explained accurately how her directions need to change to satisfy the scenario. Melissa was able to incorporate feedback from staff accurately. 

In her TSRT, Melissa delivered one set of WTD directions that met the components of WTD, but were slightly imperfect (ie. did not specify a time limit). She was therefore FA+. ",,"Cannot verify degree conferral date

In TP, Mercedes earned an FA. She projected her voice at an appropriate volume and maintained eye contact consistently, but her tone was informal at many times throughout the lesson-- saying things like ""alright, alright"" in an informal way many times throughout the lesson. In CA, Mercedes earned an FA+. She interpreted the objective correctly and addressed it in full, as she had students annotate which sections of a poem were literal language and which were figurative. Her lesson contained the most important content necessary, as she introduced what figurative and literal language is before moving into the activity. However, the closing part of her lesson was confusing, as she asked the class ""What do I mean when I say ""I'm hungry'"" and students seemed confused. In CD, Mercedes earned an FA. She did not use a model to clearly convey information, instead giving definitions for literal and figurative language. She checks for understanding often, at times asking students to support their answers with evidence. In ES, Mercedes earned an FA+. She had multiple ways of student participation-- annotating, call-and-response, cold call. However, not all participants are purposefully engaged at least twice.  In MIT, Mercedes earned an FA. She finished 45s early, with a confusing closing that was not on her TSPF. 

In CT, Mercedes earned an FA+. In her GA, Mercedes earned an FA+. In her original revision of the scenario, she correctly used specific and an observable component of WTD. She offered consistent feedback to her peers that would improve their directions and correctly implemented my feedback of being more specific in her original directions. In her RT, Mercedes earned an FA+. She accurately incorporated specific, concrete and observable in her RT directions, but they did not push towards an academic task. She could've used WTD directions in other aspects of her lesson, specifically when she has students copy down the definitions of figurative and literal language.","This candidate has a very low GPA (2.5) but worked her way through college.

The activities are logically aligned to the objective, with an aligned CFU, although they lack detail. FA

TP: FA
During Mercedes' teaching sample, she was mostly confident, though not necessarily engaging. Her voice tone and volume were both appropriate, and she maintained consistent eye contact. Although she occasionally lost economy of language due to filler, this did not detract from the content or the lesson.
CA: FA+
The objective was interpreted correctly and addressed in full. Materials were fully relevant, and content was mostly accurate. Minor inaccuracies did not detract from the lesson. Content was prioritized.
CD: FA
The lesson objective was mostly clear. Information was presented linearly (mostly lecture style). There is an attempt to check for understanding with the handout, although she did not have students share out.
ES: FA-
2-3 students volunteered responses to questions at the beginning of the lesson. Mercedes then lectured for the next few minutes and then had students complete the worksheet silently for the last minute. Selector needed to call out her name for her to recognize a raised hand.
MIT: FA
Timing was somewhat generally steady, though slightly imperfect (e.g., minute spent on worksheet at the end). She finished on time.
TSO: FA

During the group activity, Mercedes participated actively. Her initial proposed direction was specific, concrete, sequential, and observable and moved students toward the goal of copying definitions off the board. Her feedback was logical, although once she was only able to give positive feedback. She incorporated selector feedback somewhat imperfectly (out of sequence) but with accuracy. FA

During her TSRT, Mercedes' WTD directions accurately incorporated elements of sequential, observable, specific, and concrete, moving students toward the academic task of completing the worksheet. She used the technique twice. FA+

Overall, Mercedes is a mostly borderline candidate, but a particularly strong performance during her teaching sample re-teach demonstrated understanding of the WTD technique. Her TS was somewhat weak, particularly in content delivery. I believe she will need significant support but can be coached to be successful at PST and in the classroom.

In terms of CT he was rated E due to an E rating in the reteach and FA+ in TSPF and the GA.  

First, his TSPF was rated FA+.  He included clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  His directions were step by step and included a student activity of students using different stanzas to identify literal and figurative language.  He also included a logical check for student understanding using his handout and questions at the end of the lesson.  All of his key points are aligned to his objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.

Second, in terms of CT during the GA he was rated FA+.  He was able to appropriately participate in the planning for practice activity and followed all directions.  Also, he was able break down the WTD directions in a clear and logical manner.  His initial proposed directions included concrete, sequential, and observable.  His feedback to his partner, was specific, for example he stated to feedback to partner A, ""follow could be confusing because they might look at the book, you could say follow on the page,"" and to feedback partner B, ""break it into 2 parts, add an observable.""  This suggestion helped improve his partner’s directions.  His revised directions accurately incorporated my feedback.  For example, I told him to make break into table groups more concrete.  In response he stated, ""join your 2 partners by your table.""  Overall he demonstrated the ability to learn a new skill and apply that learning in a clear and logical manner.

Finally, in terms of the reteach he was rated E.  He accurately incorporated the WTD directions and my feedback into his reteach.  For example, my written grow was to tell the students what to do while they are reading the poem and he stated, ""as she reads, follow along on the page and read quietly.""  This demonstrated a clear understanding of the feedback and the ability to interpret the information clearly.  Finally his WTD directions made sense in the context of his lesson and lead students toward successfully completing an academic task.  For example, he stated, ""use your pen and underline the first two lines in stanza one.  When you are finished eyes on me.  Read stanza 2, pens up, find one word in stanza two that could be figured.  You have one minute to read quietly.  When you are done pencils down and look at me,"" as examples of successful incorporating concrete, sequential, and observable directions.  Overall he was able to incorporate WTD directions in most parts of the lesson where appropriate.  Hold up your pens and look at me.

Group Activity: During the Group Activity Mikhail was able to demonstrate multiple components of WTD directions, and was able to provide actionable feedback to the group, especially to Nathan. The reason why he is an FA+ and not an E is that when I gave him the feedback of saying his directions in less words, he has the habit of repeating things or saying filler words when he may not know what to say (maybe a nervous habit) but it hindered his ability to actually complete the feedback. 

Reteach: Mikhail received an FA in the Re Teach because he was able to incorporate WTD, however his economy of language and at times poor choice of directions lead him to have an FA.

TSPF CT: FA+ Mondel's lesson was logically and appropriately planned.  It was complete, as student and teacher actions were detailed and specific throughout the lesson.  His activities were logical, as his objective and key points were logically aligned.  He planned to use a metaphor to help teach students the concept of main idea.  He had a logical CFU, although it was basic.  TP: FA Mondel was pretty low energy, although he was confident for the majority of the lesson.  His interactions, however, weren't engaging.  He started off speaking rather softly, but his volume increased and was appropriate pretty quickly.  His tone remained professional and he maintained eye contact with his students, however, he did turn his back to his students for about 45 seconds.  His speech was succinct, but paused frequently.  CA: FA His interpretation of his objective was correct and his lesson addressed it completely.  He used examples of informational texts and the materials and questioning used were appropriate to the lesson.  His information was accurate throughout and his response to my question was accurate.  CD: FA His objective was clear to his students because it was written out and he stated it.  He presented information linearly and used a model and questioning to support mastery.  There was an attempt at a CFU, which assessed part of the objective.  ES: FA He purposefully engaged his students once, having most answer or participate by reading, and, while he had all students write down their objective, it didn't bring them closer to completing an academic task.  MIT: FA- The lesson's pacing was uneven and misallocated, as he spent too much lesson on the introduction of the material.  Additionally, he had to refer to his lesson notes, which slowed down the lesson, causing him to miss the CFU component of the lesson as he had planned it.  GA CT: FA+ During the group activity, Mondel incorporated three elements of the WTD skill into his revised instruction.  He offered two pieces of feedback that were helpful in improving his partners' instructions and his revised instructions were responsive to my feedback.  TSRT CT: FA Mondel attempted two WTD instructions, both of which were slightly imperfect.  Despite this, students were able to complete an academic task, which was a major improvement over his initial lesson.  ",,"pref: English, sped, sped English

She had a student read the objective and asked some students questions - ""why did you stand at 'resolution' instead of conflict?""  Montana was a E in ES because she had all students complete the do now and stand up to show the part of their story on the plot. She also cold called 4 students. Montana was a FA+ in CA because she used activities that were aligned and relevant - had students identify part of a text to determine the part of the plot. Lastly, she was a FA in MIT because her pace was steady and she ended the lesson with 20 seconds left. She also spent most of the lesson having students determine the part of the plot. During the group activity (FA), Montana proposed directions included all 4 parts of WTD directions however she struggled to provided a glow and a grow for each partner. However, her feedback was concrete and specific. For example, she told a partner to be more specific about which group he wanted the students to get into (reading group, writing group, etc).

Nancy earned an FA on the TSPF. Most key points were aligned to the objective and activities were explained in sufficient detail. The planned CFU was logical and aligned to the objective. 

Nancy was FA in TP because she was visibly nervous at times, and was not consistently engaging. She maintained eye contact and an appropriate tone and volume of voice, but did not demonstrate economy of language.

Nancy's overall TS was FA+ due to her strength in ES and CD. With respect to ES, Nancy had all students create a triangle using straws and determine whether it was equilateral, scalene or isosceles. She engaged all students academically by asking each one to share their triangles and defend their determination and was therefore FA+ in ES. With respect to CD Nancy was FA+ because the lesson objective was clear, she presented information linearly by going over definitions and showing a visual model and checked for understanding. In terms of CA, Nancy was FA+ because the activities and questions were aligned to the objective and logical. It should be noted that constructing the triangles and determining whether they were equilateral/scalene/isosceles was the only activity that students completed during the TS. Additionally, Nancy started her lesson 30 seconds late. Mismanagement of time occurred again in the TSRT. 

Nancy struggled during the GA. She initially went to the incorrect group. Throughout the activity, Nancy worked on her own WTD directions and was unable to give 'grows' to her partners. Nancy's initial WTD directions met all the components of the technique, but she was unable to re-deliver her directions given feedback. Nancy was asked to specify where in their notebook to write down the definitions, however she simply again repeated that students should copy the definitions into their notebooks. She earned an FA overall.

In the TSRT, Nancy delivered one set of WTD directions that met two components of WTD. The directions were slightly imperfect and did not lead toward completion of an academic task. She earned an FA for the TSRT. It should be noted that after Nancy delivered her directions, she circulated, laughed with her peers and therefore did not teach continuously.

Nichol earned an FA+ on the TSPF. The activities were logical, aligned and described in some detail. The final CFU however was slightly misaligned to the objective. The objective was to distinguish fact from opinion in an informational text, however the closing CFU asks students to come up with their own facts and opinions. 

Nichol earned an FA+ in TP. She projected her voice, maintained eye contact and was confident in her interactions with the class. She did not, however consistently demonstrate economy of language. 

Overall Nichol was FA+ in ES. She engaged all students once in an activity in which they read sentences and determined if they were fact or opinion. She also asked for volunteers and cold called one student, which meant that she engaged most students in more than one way. With respect to CD Nichol used a model to teach the differences between fact and opinion, had students apply the skill on several examples and asked for their reasoning. At the closing, she read aloud a paragraph and had students identify facts and opinions within and explain their answers. She was therefore E in CD as she used CFU multiple times. In terms of CA, Nichol was FA+ because the materials were logical given the objective, content was accurate, and activities were aligned to the objective. Nichol earned an FA+ in MIT because she had to adjust timing at the end of her TS to begin work on the CFU. 

In the GA, Nichol's initial directions met all four components of WTD, she gave feedback that improved her partner's directions and she was able to incorporate staff feedback. She therefore earned an E.

In the TSRT, Nichol delivered 3 WTD directions that met at least 3 components of the skill. She used the WTD directions to set students to work on an academic task and drive instruction forward.

Omar did address the objective, however, the majority of the time was spent going over the definitions of the different elements of plot, and thus the students did not have much time to apply the 5 stages of plot. He gave them 20 seconds to discuss the five stages to a movie of their choosing. CD is FA.

TSPF CT: FA+ Osele's lesson was appropriately planned and the key points and objective were logically aligned.  The lesson included activities and a flow that made logical sense and the CFU was appropriate and logical.  The lesson was broken down into multiple steps and only the most important information was included, along with guided and independent practice.  Thoughout the lesson, it was clear what students would be doing.  TP: FA+ Osele was consistently confident throughout the lesson and attempted to be engaging with her body and voice.  She projected at an appropriate level and maintained a formal tone throughout the lesson.  She also maintained eye contact throughout the lesson and faced the class the entire time.  She spoke succinctly and there were instances of EOL.  CA: FA The interpretation of the objective was accurate and she used examples and material that was logical, prioritizing the content, focusing on the content.  Her examples and activities were logical and relevant, although she kept calling supporting details supportive details, a minor misstatement, considering it's part of her objective.  CD: FA+ The objective was clear because she stated it and she used two models to convey information.  She also had a CFU with all students participating.  ES: FA+ She had students raise their hands, answer questions, underline parts of the text related to the objective, and cold call students.  All students had one opportunity to participate and most had a second opportunity.  MIT: FA+ She used her time well and the lesson was consistently well-paced throughout.  The majority of the lesson time was spent on the objective and content.  GA CT: FA+ Osele's initial WTD instructions incorporated 3 components of the skill.  Throughout the activity, she was able to give every partner strong glows and grows, some of which helped them to improve their instructions, and she required a higher-level piece of feedback from me.  TSRT CT: FA+ Osele's reteach incorporated one perfect WTD instruction, which was academically oriented and helped students complete an academic task.  This demonstrated that she understood both the purpose and utility of the skill and could incorporate it accurately.","Ms. Osele Clifford submitted an application last year but was rejected because of concerns about her professionalism.

He prioritized time on identifying them in text and used a poem which displayed mastery of the objective. He conveyed accurate content the entire time except his definition of figurative language was somewhat unclear. He said ""using words that deviate from the explicit definition"". In CD he scored an FA+. The lesson objective was clear to participants. He used a model of a poem to find literal and figurative terms and he asked a student to explain why a statement was figurative. In ES he scored an FA. All students wrote down notes. Three students answered a question to share if a statement was literal or figurative. All students read the poem to themself. In MIT he scored an FA.

He lacked economy of language at points, which placed him in FA+. With respect to ES, Pedro took volunteers, cold called several students, had everyone take notes, assigned group work, gave students a problem to solve on their own.

She engaged sts by having them read aloud, answering questions on a worksheet where sts filled in the blanks, and then a share out at end where she asked 3 sts to share.  All sts were engaged at least once in the lesson and some were engaged in more than one way.

In the GA, her initial directions included 3 components of WTD, she made helpful and accurate suggestions to her partners and her revised directions accurately incorporated feedback from me.  In her reteach, she used WTD accurately and appropriately in her lesson in several places.  Her directions were clear but do not move sts toward completing an academic task.

She was able to get through a fairly dense lesson, about an objective that is done very often, quickly and with purpose, without feeing rushed. She received an FA + in ES because all students participated at least once when completing an example from the worksheet she provied. She also received an FA+ in CD because of her incorporation of guiding questions to help students determine what the author's purpose is. By asking students to  Does this text convince me? Does this text teach me? Does this text amuse me? She is providing to students a way to assess the author's purpose independently, and not simply relying on the use of the words inform, entertain, or persuade. Even though entertain does not inherently mean to be amused, given the the lesson is only 5 minutes long, she used her time effectively. 

Group Activity: Rachael was very strong during the Group Activity, she most definitely took a leadership role in the group being one of the few candidates to provide actionable glows and grows. Her directions incorporated multiple components of What to Do directions. An example being: ""Revised Direction: Once you have finished reading the article, silently underline key ideas, when you're done please put your pencils down."" The candidate was able to provide multiple components, provide actionable feedback, and incorporate the feedback I provided to her so she receives an FA+.

Re-Teach: The candidate receives an E in Re-teach because of her clear incorporation of What to Do to complete an academic task in her re-teach. An example of directions she provided is: ""Please locate example 2 on your worksheet, place your pen on number 2 so I know you know where you are. When I say begin, you will silently read the example, once that is done, circle yes or no for questions 1,2,3, then answer the final question of the author's purpose. I know you are done when you have pencils down and eyes on me."" Overall this candidate was strong throughout the interview and she will be a strong candidate for the summer.

Her examples are in service to the objective. In CD, Rachel earned an FA+. She used a model to clearly convey information-- a model of texting a friend. She frequently checked for understanding by asking students to support the details they presented with evidence. In ES, Rachel earned an FA+. She used cold call, call-and-respond, and guided notes to push student's thinking on how to find a main idea and a supporting detail in a paragraph. In MIT, Rachel earned an E.

Ralph's TS presented mixed evidence. His TP was strong (FA+), in that he effectively varied his tone to build engagement. He spoke loudly and clearly, demonstrating economy of language at most points. His interpretation of the objective was correct and he provided accurate content. The activities are relevant, but a lack of prioritization means that student practice is omitted (CA - FA). Ralph stated his objective and modeled fact v. opinion with a t-chart. There was a partial attempt to CFU through questioning (CD - FA). Most students were engaged through questioning, and a few had an opportunity to read (ES - FA). Pace was uneven and lesson time misallocated: an overlong opening meant that student practice did not occur (MIT - FA-). 

Ralph demonstrated strength in CTO (FA+). Ralph's TSPF presented mixed, but primarily positive, evidence for CT. He addresses the objective of fact vs. opinion in full and most activities are aligned. Key points and closing introduce some irrelevant musings about the importance of viewing learning as a life-long process. During the group activity, Ralph's initial directions were concrete, specific, and observable. He gave feedback that would improve at least two of his partners direction. Ralph was asked to incorporate economy of language, and he was largely successful. In the reteach, Ralph's addressed my feedback and gave directions that incorporated at least two elements of WTD.

In terms of CT he was rated FA with an E rating in the TSPF and FA- during the GA.  

In terms of TS he was rated FA+ due to FA+ in ES and CA.

In terms of CA he was rated FA+.  Overall he presented a teaching sample that was in service to his stated learning objective. First, his interpretation of the objective was correct and the lesson addressed the objective in full for example he focused on literal and figurative language and used simile and metaphor to explain figurative.  Second, he prioritized the content of and spent most of the time on what was most important for mastery of the objective. For example, students read and compared two poems with the lens of literal and figurative.  Third, he used materials, examples, and activities in service of the objective, for example he used the model of types of figurative and the comparison of two poems.  Also, during the lesson he conveyed accurate content throughout the lesson.  Finally he demonstrated the ability to analyze and interpret information accurately.

In terms of ES he was rated FA+.  His lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  He purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example he asked students to read poems, answer questions, and give examples from their reading.  These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, he gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students could read, write responses, and verbally answer questions.  He also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students compare two poems using the definition of literal and figurative language.  During the lesson he cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall he intentional engaged all the students throughout his lesson.

In terms of CT he was rated FA with an E rating in the TSPF and FA- in GA.

First, his TSPF was rated E.  He included clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  His directions were step by step and included a student activity of having students identify figurative and literal language.  He also included a check for student understanding using questions and handouts.  All of his key points are aligned to his objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.  In addition, his planned check for student understanding requires the students to demonstrate mastery of the lesson.

In terms of CT during the GA he was rated FA-.  He was confused by my feedback, ""make taking out the hw more concrete by adding a how,"" and he stated that, ""it seems specific to me.""  He then responded with, ""reach in your book bag and grab your hw assignment.""  In addition he was unable to offer any grows to his 3 feedback partners.  To the first feedback partner he said nothing and the other two he only offered glows.

In the TSPF, he received an FA+ because student and teacher actions are explained in detail and all activities are logically aligned to the given objective.  The TS was a strength for Robert. His TP was rated an E because he was engaging and projected his voice at varying levels. He was confident throughout the lesson and maintained eye contact the whole time. He also has a strength with economy of language. CD was a strength with an E because he checked for understanding 6 times during the lesson and they were a variety of checks. Some checks are about the content and others are about directions. During the activity of underlining for opinion and fact, after delivering the instruction for how to underline (facts in green, opinion in yellow) he checks for understanding of which color should be used after reading the first sentence and before layering on new information. He also received an E for ES because all students were engaged 3x, both verbally and with writing. He used cold call and volunteers frequently to provide options to participate. His one weakness was in MIT, where he received an FA, he finished his activity early with 30 seconds left and rushed to get there after the 1 minute warning. However, the bulk of his lesson was spent on the most essential content. During the GA, Robert received an FA+, his proposed directions included an observable (eyes on me), they were in sequential and logical order, and they were specific. The feedback, to make it more concrete by telling students exactly how they would be acting (silently) was immediately incorporated. He also provided very good feedback to his peers that pushed their directions to be more clear and sequential. Robert received an FA+ in the RT. His directions incorporated concrete (quickly and quietly), sequential (pick up pencil, write name on top, when done all eyes on me) and was observable (eyes on me, pick up pencils). He also incorporated the feedback about giving WTD for what students should do while he models. His WTD moved the lesson forward. A weakness was in making them more specific, as there were parts that could have been added.

He received an FA in ES because he did not have all students participate at least once, as most students participated through volunteered responses. He received a FA in CD because of his mostly linear delivery. He had definition, he provided an example, and then the class worked on the rest of the examples together. 

Group Activity: During the Group Activity, the candidate was able to incorporate at least 3 components of What to Do and incorporate my feedback of limiting the use of his notes. Here is an example of directions he gave. ""Revised: Class eyes on me, take out history textbook and turn to page 5, place your finger of the title, follow along with your finger as you read. Gave a glow and a grow to Devon about perhaps being more sequential."" Candidate received a FA+ because of his incorporation of What to Do and his ability to give both glows and grows during the feedback rounds. 

Re-Teach: Candidate received a FA in in Re-Teach because he mostly only used observables as his directions, telling students to put their pens on the part of the page that he was reading from. He understands how to incorporate What to Do directions which was demonstrated in the Group Activity. Here is an example of directions: ""Please place your pen on the first example. Please underline the part of the sentence that indicates parallel structure. Underline the ing at the end of each word and when you're done eyes on me."" Place your pen, eyes down on me is all observables, the academic task is underlining.

She used examples and activities that were mostly logical and relevant and related to the lesson objected and conveys accurate content necessary for students to achieve the stated objective even though the informational text was missing. She earned an FA rating for CA. The objective was clear to students, as she stated it at the beginning of the lesson and she used a model to convey information. Roleydy checked for understanding by asking students to apply a skill and asking them to explain their answers during whole group discussion. All participants engaged in a written activity and most participated in discussion by way of volunteering responses.

His lesson was mostly FA, but had some strengths in ES. His obj was to teach S how to distinguish between fact and opinion in an informational text. He began by showing S a pink pig-shaped timer, and told S that it was pink and awesome. S then noted that one statement was a fact and the other was an opinion. He briefly defined fact (it can be proven), but did not define opinion clearly. Then S read an article about climate change and identified the facts and opinions, but they did not finish going over the answers. The lesson was FA in CA: he failed to answer my Q (""how do I find an opinion?""), some of his info was a little confusing, and not enough of the time was spent on mastery. In CD, he was also FA: he used a model to demonstrate a fact and opinion, but his CFU was incomplete and some of his info was unclear. His lesson was also FA in MIT: he misallocated some of the time, so he ran out of time at the end. He was FA+ in ES: all the S worked in groups to find facts and opinions, and some S answered Qs aloud. Overall, the lesson was FA+ in TSO due to an FA+ in ES.

His TP was  FA. He was audible and confident and attempted to be engaging, but he also lost formal tone a few times and was a little rambling.

During the GA, he drafted directions that incorporated some elements of concrete, seq and obs. He was open to fdbk, though he asked a lot of Qs and attempted to incorporate it without complete accuracy. Thus, he was FA+ in GACT. During the TSR, he incorporated WTD 1x, and it included seq, obs, and concrete elements. The direction also improved the clarity of his activity and his lesson was improved overall. Thus, he was FA+ in TSR CT and FA+ in CTO.

A review of his file indicates no concerns. He was rated FA+ in CT by his phone interviewer and has some exp as a volunteer teacher at an Arab-American center. Overall, his IE demonstrated some strengths in CT and ES, so I recommend him to the program.",,BA in History/French conferred 1/2011,#N/A

The TSPF is completed logically and appropriately.  There two key points that are clearly aligned to the chosen objective.  Teacher and student actions are listed with full detail.  There is a check for understanding that asks students to determine their level of understanding based on the objective. Rosa began the lesson confidently and remained that way throughout the entire lesson.  She successfully used a variety of tones to be engaging and spoke clearly and succinctly.  Her tone was formal, yet warm and engaging.  When asked the selector question, she exercised economy of language while answering the question accurately and effectively.  Rosa's interpretation of the chosen objective was correct and the lesson and lesson activities were completely aligned.  At the start of the lesson, Rosa explicitly stated the objective for the day so that it was clear to students.  She used a simple model (Itsy Bitsy Spider) to help students understand the five stages of plot in a fictional text.  Rosa used color coded cards for students to hold up at the corresponding parts of the story, which was an effective method of engagement that resulted in all students participating more than one time.  Rosa cold called as well as took volunteers for lesson questions.  Students also utilized a worksheet that had students identify the five stages of plot in a fictional text, where they wrote which stage was for each part of the text.  Rosa spent the entire lesson focusing on the most important content for mastery of the objective.  All of the lesson activities were in service to the objective and completely appropriate.  Rosa demonstrated strength in the area of maximizing instructional time.  When she received the one-minute warning, she adjusted the lesson in order to summarize the lesson and check for understanding.  The check for understanding required students to identify the parts of a plot, but did not require students to explain and justify their responses.  However, during the check for understanding, it was clear that students had understood the objective. During the group activity, Rosa remained on task and focused.  Rosa's initial proposed directions incorporated all components of WTD although not in the most clear or concise way.  She utilized the feedback cheat sheet accurately and without difficulties in order to give her group members feedback. She implemented group member feedback accurately and when she gave feedback tried to give examples that would improve group members WTD. Since she was a high performing candidate, selector feedback was economy of language.  Although she didn’t implement it with complete accuracy, the attempt was made. During the reteach Rosa attempted to use WTD to move students towards the completion of an academic task. She gave the WTD but they were given in a way that was unclear and very lengthy. She successfully incorporated WTD but in a way that was not as clear or seamless as it could have been. Despite this, she demonstrated tremendous strength with the teaching sample. As a result, it is recommended that Rosa be a select-in candidate.

All students were engaged in reading the text and making each sentence and each student shared about one sentence (ES E).  The pace was steady throughout and she adjusted for time in the last minute (MIT FA+).  During the GA she showed a strong understanding of the skill of WTD.  Her first set of directions had all of the elements, but was missing a little piece of concrete feedback.  I gave that feedback and she accurately incorporated that feedback.  During the feedback portion she gave a lot of great feedback that was related to WTD and she even pushed her partners to give her better feedback, when they struggled to give her feedback.

He used MLK's Letter from Birmingham Jail... His TSPF was detailed and included teacher and student actions, but his third act was off-objective. He made connections to current social movements, but did not connect this piece of the lesson to the objective. It was thematically linked, but not linked in the standard. He ultimately did not get to that portion of his lesson in the TS, and so is only FA in MIT (the lesson was otherwise well-paced.) He had a confident, student-facing TP, with some lack of economy of language, but is holistically FA+ in TP. In CA, some of his examples seemed to be more about context rather than POV, but context can give us some clues about POV, so he is FA in CA. He stated his objective, and asked students to independently identify words and support with evidence, but he does not gather the data so I'm not counting it as a clear CFU, and he is FA in CD. All of his students read individually and annotated, and some shared, so he is FA+ in ES. During the GA, he misunderstood the task by writing a narrative about his classroom (I would ask the students to take their notebooks out, I would tell them they have a minute) rather than a script, but he fixed this before we got to the selector feedback exercise. He gave some solid feedback to partners, and was moderatley successful in my request to modify the sequence of his directions. He gave some more directions in his TSRT,  askijng students to follow along silently, but did not demonstrate a clear understanding of WTD direcitons, so he is only FA- in TSRTCT, and FA in CTO.

In terms of TP he was rated FA+.  He exhibited an ease, poise, and self-assurance with his interactions with the class.  He also demonstrated a confidence in his interactions.  He projected his voice and used both formal and informal tone depending on the part of the class.  In addition his tone was at an appropriate volume.  He maintained eye contact with the students and was always facing the class.  Finally, he spoke succinctly and clearly throughout the lesson and displayed instances of economy of language.
 
In terms of TS he was FA due to FA- in MIT and FA+ in ES.

In terms of ES he was rated FA+.  His lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  He purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example students read silently, answered questions, and wrote notes.   These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, he gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students could read, write and respond verbally.  He also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students answer questions from the handout.   During the lesson he cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall he intentional engaged all the students throughout his lesson.

In terms of MIT he was rated FA- with a TS that had an uneven pace and a misallocation of time.  For example, students read his handout for over 2 minutes with no teacher action during that time.  Also he finished the lesson with 30 seconds left over at the 4:30 mark.  

Overall Samuel meets the bar for acceptance and is selected in.

It was detailed and logically aligned. The CFU asks the students to apply the skill but the lesson activities do not facilitate mastery of the objective.  During the teaching sample her TP was FA.  She spoke clearly throughout the lesson, but EOL was not a strength.  Also she did not attempt to engage the student through tone or body language.  Her TSO was FA+.  She stated the objective at the start of the lesson, to distinguish fact and opinion in a nonfiction text.  She then just stated the definitions and started in the text. She did not model how to find facts and opinions, she just relied on the prior knowledge of the students.  The work in the text would serve as a check because she did have the students underline the facts and circle the opinions (CD FA).  All the activities were aligned to the objective, but there was an inaccuracy when address the coach question (CA FA). All students read in a text and underlined in the text and most students responded to questions (ES FA+).  Her lesson was steady in pace and she did try and rush at the end to finish the text (MIT FA).  During the GA she showed and understanding of WTD.  She offered some feedback to both of her partners that was related to WTD.  Her final set of directions needed some work on the concrete elements and she incorporated that feedback. In the reteach, she added WTD directions at the beginning of the reteach, to gather all the students attention and had them following along in the text to circle or underline as they went.

She also received a FA+ in CA because she interpreted the objective in a way that fully addressed its components and used materials that supported the mastery. she received a FA in CD because of her linear, delivery, even though it was effective. 

Group Activity: Shannon received a FA+in GA because she was able to incorporate multiple components of WTD in her directions, an example is ""Revised Direction: Please stop what you're doing, find your name and number, thumbs up, quickly and quietly go to your assigned group, bring your homework from last night and sit down go counterclock wise to share answers in a whisper voice."" She was able to implement my feedback of delivering the directions in fewer words and was able to give actionable feedback to fellow candidates, for example, she was able to give feedback about being more specific about what students should have on their desk.

All they had to do was underline what she told them to underline.  A sample of  the directions are: ""Take out their packet titled what is photosynthesis.

There is a check for understanding that is aligned with the objective, as the teacher will ask students to name a part of the respiratory system and explain it's function.

CA The way Sharivia interpreted the chosen objective was correct and the lesson addressed the objective fully.  She used a visual poster to help students clearly understand the objective and provided a worksheet for students to match parts with their functions. Sharivia spent the majority of the lesson covering the most important material, as she went through each of the parts using the visual diagram. The lesson activity was clearly aligned to the chosen objective and helped moved students towards understanding the objective. The objective was clearly written on a poster, therefore the objective was clear to the students. Sharivia checked for understanding in part as she went over two of the remaining examples on the worksheet that students were required to complete on their own. Sharivia struggled slightly when it came to engaging students.  Out of seven candidates, only four students volunteered answers and spoke.  There weren't many opportunities for student engagement as they completed a worksheet that required them to draw a line from the part of the respiratory system to the corresponding function.  Sharivia's initial planned directions incorporated 3 of the components of WTD directions.  When she received selector feedback, she excelled, incorporating all components.  She remained focused and on task throughout the group activity.  She struggled slightly using the language of the feedback cheat sheet.  However she was consistently trying to give feedback directly from the feedback cheat sheet. Sharivia even gave examples on how her group members could have improved their directions. Her revised directions incorporated group member feedback so the selector feedback was economy of language.  Sharivia was able to apply this feedback accurately.

Teacher and student actions are outlined clearly and in detail.  Based on the TSPF there is a check for understanding where students will have to complete two, two-step equations to solve for the value of an unknown variable. Stephanie was confident throughout the lesson, but her tone was not necessarily engaging.  Despite this, she did use multiple methods to engage students.  She asked several questions and took volunteers.  As she worked through examples of problems on the board she also cold called different students.  Students were required to follow along with what she wrote on the board as well as completing a basic set of guided notes, where students had to fill in several blanks.  The way Stephanie interpreted the chosen objective was correct and the lesson addressed the objective fully.  She spent time on the most important content by briefly reviewing inverse operations, but making sure that students understood how to solve the two-step equations.  The example was appropriate and aligned as it was a basic two-step equation that she and the students worked through together.  Although the lesson objective was not explicitly stated, it was clear to the students through the examples used.  The check for understanding was not clear as the candidate ran out of time before she could check for understanding. Stephanie failed to make adjustments to her lesson based on time and therefore the lesson had a rushed finish.  Stephanie remained on task and focused throughout the group activity.  She attempted to use the feedback cheat sheet with uneven results.  She struggled giving one of her group members a grow, but eventually gave one to one of her group members.  She didn’t use the language of the feedback cheat sheet completely, but did use it as a point of reference.  Her initial planned directions incorporated three WTD components accurately.  Her revised directions did not necessarily incorporate group member feedback accurately, as she added in ""when I ring the bell"" as a signal to start as opposed to an observable. When urged to use a different observable, she was unable to do so. During the reteach, Stephanie attempted to use WTD.  She did so successfully. She used WTD multiple times in ways that moved students towards the completion of an academic task.  This demonstrates her strength in critical thinking.  Despite the fact that she struggled with maximizing instructional time, Stephanie showed strength in the other areas of the teaching sample, therefore, it is recommended that she be a select-in candidate.",,"psych degree 12/2014

Student activities are somewhat lacking in detail (e.g., ""students will work along side the teacher"") but logical. FA

TP: FA
During his TS, Stephen was mostly confident, though not necessarily engaging. His voice was a bit quiet, though comprehensible. He was mostly succinct, with occasional filler.
CA: FA+
The objective was interpreted correctly, and the full objective was addressed, including an informational text. Examples, activities, materials, and discussion were all in service to the objective, and all content was accurate. 
CD: FA
The objective was explicitly stated and printed on the handout. He modeled ""opinion"" but did not model ""fact"". However, he did ask some students to support their responses with how they arrived at the answer.
ES: FA+
All students worked independently on the DN, on the sample sentences, and on the informational text. Most students (6 out of 7) had the opportunity to identify whether a sentence was a fact or an opinion, and several were asked to support their responses with evidence.
MIT: FA
The lesson pace was somewhat steady, with chunks of time allocated toward independent student work.

TSO: FA+

During the group activity, Stephen participated actively and professionally, although he was visibly and audibly frustrated (I think with himself) when the two minutes were up and he hadn't finished writing his directions. His initial proposed directions were somewhat concrete and sequential, although they could have been more specific. He gave feedback to one of his colleagues to help make it more concrete, although to his partner, he only gave positive feedback. He incorporated feedback by directing students to ""page 2"" of their notepads. FA

During his TSRT, Stephen used the WTD technique to move students toward the academic task of identifying whether sentences are fact or opinion. He incorporated elements of sequential and observable, although it could have been more specific or concrete. He used the technique once. FA

Overall, Stephen is a select in due to a spike in his TS with student engagement, although he is borderline in all other areas. There were also small moments of professionalism concern--he expressed irritation or frustration at both climbing the stairs and at not having enough time to finish writing his WTD directions. His TP is also borderline. I think he will require significant support in order to be successful, but according to the model, he is a select in.

His objective was mostly aligned to activities in his lesson. 
He scored a FA+ in TP because he displayed evidence of EOL but paused several times and/or turned his back to the class on several occasions to write on the board. He turned away from the class for at least 10-15 seconds. When he was facing the class, he was able to project his voice and maintain eye contact. He also was confidant during the lesson and demonstrated several instances of EOL. Thomas scored a FA in CA because Thomas conveyed correct content. However since he did not provide any examples and the only activity was labeling a worksheet during the lesson, which was aligned to the objective.  Thomas used materials (a worksheet) that required students to label each type of consumer, decomposer, or producer. Thomas was a FA in CD because he stated the objective so it was clear to students. He did not have a model but presented information in a linear fashion. Thomas attempted to CFU by having students help him label a pyramid.  Thomas scored a FA+ in ES because all student determined consumer, producer or decomposer on their worksheets and then he called on most students to help him complete a pyramid on the board. Thomas scored a FA+ in MIT, During the lesson Thomas' pace was steady and he spent most of the lesson having students practice a skill. Thomas was a FA during the group activity because he did not provide any glows for either of his partners. However, he stayed on topic in the pair and told his partner to put their direction in sequential order. During the re-teach, Thomas gave one WTD direction but did not include a visual step. He did not include WTD directions in the rest of the lesson because he simply told students how to complete the worksheet and told them they had 10 minutes to complete it. 

During the interview, Thomas was professional and had clear communication skills. I recommend that Thomas is accepted into the NYCTF program due to his TP. ","Candidate's GPA improves throughout college career (the last 4 semesters are all As, Bs, and a few Cs). In the GPA statement, the candidate takes ownership of why they struggled early (skipped the basic level classes because of AP credit, but was not prepared to handle the upper level courses).

He prioritizes the content and spends the most time on explaining how the respiratory system works. He uses accurate examples and diagrams to show the respiratory process. For CD, he presents the information in a way that is slightly confusing and placing an emphasis on reading an article about the respiratory system. He talks about the content but does not model it in a way that participants can understand. His questions were not adequate CFUs merely attempts to recall information from the reading. For ES, he asks students to read, answer questions, and label a diagram. For MIT, he completes the lesson in the allotted time and his lesson has a steady pace.

Most key points are aligned to his objective. He included a component in his objective to have students draw the structure of the atom but that was not addressed until towards the end of the lesson and was more a check for understanding as opposed to what he taught during the lesson. He did address what teacher and expected student responses should be throughout the lesson and most of the activities were aligned to the objective. He had students define the different parts of atoms and use a worksheet to fill in the blanks and answer problems about the structure of the atom. His CFU was logical and addressed the objective in full but as aforementioned it was during the CFU that he first addressed the drawing component of his objective. Thomas's TP rating was FA as candidate appeared nervous but it did not interfere with his instruction and he became more confident as the lesson went on. He projected his voice and maintained a formal tone. He did have his back turned towards the board a few times throughout the lesson. He spoke clearly but there were moments of pausing while he transitioned. His CA rating was FA as his interpretation of the provided objective was correct and his response to my question was accurate and clear. He also used activities and worksheets to have students label the atomic structure and that was all relevant to his lesson. His CD was FA as the candidate did use materials and questions to help students support mastery of the objective. However his CFU only addressed the objective at least in part, he focused more on students describing the atomic structure and not on constructing the atomic structure as he outlined in his objective as well. His ES was FA+ as he engaged all participants at least once during the lesson that was designed to drive instruction forward, he asked students to define the atomic structures verbally by cold calling and to label the atomic structure on a worksheet as well. His MIT was FA as he presented a rushed finish to the end of his lesson although the pace was steady. His GA rating was FA+ as his initial proposed directions were concrete, sequential and observable. His feedback was to make the directions more specific and he was able to do. He also was able to incorporate my feedback and use economy of language when revising his direction. The feedback he gave his partner was also logical and appropriate. His Reteach was FA+ as he accurately incorporated WTD directions to guide students to complete a problem on the worksheet. The directions were specific and concrete. Overall Thomas is recommended to be selected in as his Teaching Sample rating was FA+.He also scored FA+ in his Group Activity and Reteach. He demonstrates he can implement and deliver feedback and I believe once he becomes more confident with students his TP will develop. Candidate also came highly recommended.

In terms of TP she was rated FA+.  She exhibited an ease, poise, and self-assurance with her interactions with the class.  She also demonstrated a confidence in her interactions.  She projected her voice and used both formal and informal tone depending on the part of the class.  In addition her tone was at an appropriate volume.  She maintained eye contact with the students and was always facing the class.  Finally, she spoke succinctly and clearly throughout the lesson and displayed instances of economy of language.

In terms of TS she was rated FA+ due to FA+ in CA and ES.

In terms of CA she was rated FA+.  Overall she presented a teaching sample that was in service to her stated learning objective. First, her interpretation of the objective was correct and the lesson addressed the objective in full for example she used a non example at the start to state the learning objective and then her questions at the end of the lesson referenced the objective.  Second, she prioritized the content of and spent most of the time on what was most important for mastery of the objective which was solving the sample problem.  Third, she used materials, examples, and activities in service of the objective, for example she the example of a closed versus an open equation to introduce the objective and she used a sample problem to solve with the class.  Also, during the lesson she conveyed accurate content throughout the lesson.  Finally she demonstrated the ability to analyze and interpret information accurately.

In terms of ES she was rated FA+.  Her lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  She purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example she asked questions regarding the content, the computation, and the process.  At the end of the lesson she asked students to complete their own problem independently.   These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, she gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students could answer verbally and solve their own problem.  She also used her final questions as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding.  During the lesson she cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall she intentional engaged all the students throughout her lesson.

In terms of CT she was rated FA overall with a FA+ in the TSPF.

Her TSPF was rated FA+.  She included clear instructions for the teacher and the students (some of the student directions were also in the teacher directions).  Her directions were step by step and included a student activity of solving an equation.  She also included a logical check for student understanding using a sample problem at the end.  All of her key points are aligned to her objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally,  the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.  

Overall, Tiffany exceeds the bar for acceptance and is selected in.

It was planned logically and completely and key points were aligned and explained in detail.  His activity included clear instructions for what students would be doing during the class. Check for understanding is clear and addresses the lesson objective and content. The only weakness is that students do not actually draw the atom. However, the lesson allows students to understand the nucleus and that it contains the protons and neutrons with electrons circling. 
The overall TS was rated an FA+. TP was a strength. He was warm and engaging in terms of his tone and his voice level was appropriate throughout the taught lesson. CA was a weakness. His objective stated that students should draw an atom, however during the lesson students did not get a chance to draw. Instead, they used the periodic table and an equation to define the number of protons and electrons in a given atom. Despite this, students did learn about the internal structure of an atom when they were provided with an image and a method for determining the essential components of an atom like the protons, neutrons and electrons. All of his answers were correct. CD was a strength, his objective was communicated well and he used a model to teach. The CFU was particularly strong because he used it before layering on new content and he CFU multiple times. He received an FA+ in ES. He engaged all students at least once by doing cold call twice during the lesson and he used it to push academic thinking. Students participated verbally throughout the lesson and wrote. During the GA, he received a E because his WTD directions were a strength. He was able to integrate all of his peers feedback and the feedback from the selector was taken into account. He also provided glows and grows to his peers that supported them in writing better WTD, although he frequently did not elaborate on the grows by providing a concrete example of specifically how to make a direction more concrete. Feedback from the selector was in the range of the high performing candidate and focused on economy of language. He is FA+ in the RT because he demonstrated a clear understanding of the concrete and specific portions of the WTD and incorporates into his instructions.

The TSPF is completed logically and appropriately.  There are two key points that are clearly aligned to the chosen objective.  Teacher and student actions are listed but lack detail.  There is a check for understanding that asks students to draw their own triangles to determine their level of understanding based on the objective. Vanessa began the lesson confidently and remained that way throughout the duration of the lesson.  She attempted to use a variety of tones to be engaging and when asked a selector question, she exercised economy of language.  Vanessa answered the question succinctly and tied the answer in to the activity that students were completing.  Vanessa's interpretation of the chosen objective was full and correct.  The lesson activity was clearly aligned to the chosen objective and move students towards mastery of the content.  Students had to find the missing angle and once they had done so, they then had to classify the triangles based on the measurements of the angles.  Although Vanessa spent sometime introducing triangles, the materials used were relevant and she did spend the majority of the lesson on the most important content for mastery.  At the beginning of the lesson, Vanessa explicitly stated the objective so that it was clear to students.  Vanessa did lecture for a large portion of the lesson, which didn’t afford much opportunity for student engagement in many different ways. She relied a lot on choral responses.  However, when reviewing the lesson she did cold call each student once, which allowed student engagement.  In addition, students were required to write their answers on the worksheet.  She did include a check for understanding, which was clearly aligned to the objective, however, when reviewing the activity, and checking for understanding, she did not require that students explain and justify their reasoning for classifying the triangle the way that they did. Despite this, it was clear that students had mastered the objective partially, if not fully. During the group activity, Vanessa remained on task and focused.  Vanessa's initial proposed directions incorporated all components of WTD although not in the most clear or concise way.  She utilized the feedback cheat sheet accurately and without difficulties in order to give her group members feedback. She implemented group member feedback accurately and when she gave feedback tried to give examples that would improve group members WTD. Since she was a high performing candidate, selector feedback was economy of language.  Although she didn’t implement it with complete accuracy, the attempt was made. She lost some of the components. During the reteach, Vanessa directed, ""Take out your calculators and place them on your desk. You have two minutes to silently calculate angle measurements and then identify the triangle, pens down and eyes on me when you’re done.""  This incorporates all components of WTD and moves students towards the completion of an academic task.  This clearly demonstrates Vanessa's understanding of the WTD strategy.  For these reasons, it is recommended that Vanessa be a select-in candidate. ",,"couldn't locate conferral date on transcript

In the TSPF Venise scored an E. The candidate clearly explains how students will be reading a text and identifying the differences and similarities between plant and animal cells. The key points align to the objective and the CFU of an exit ticket seems to demonstrate mastery. 

Overall in the TS Venise scored an E. In TP she scored an FA+. She was engaging in the lesson and maintained eye contact the entire time. She attempted to be engaging and she observed economy of language at some points.  In CA she scored an E. She used a reading that clearly defined the differences and similarities between plant and animal cells. She used materials that were in service to the objective and conveyed accurate content the entire time.  In CD she scored an FA+. The lesson objective was clear to participants. She modeled how to analyze the text and she asked students to provide evidence ""what specifically about the chloroplast?."" In ES she scored an E. All students shared a verbal answer to the questions. All students read independently and filled in the other side of the T chart. All questions were answered. In MIT she scored an FA+. The lesson pace was steady and she presented a completed lesson. Most of the lesson was spent on identifying the similarities and differences between plant and animal cells 

Asked her partner if she stated an observable. In the direction she stated to the group it included all elements She agreed with her partners feedback and incorporated it into her partners direction. She suggested to her partner to give a longer time frame. In the direction she presented to me it was missing a concrete element. She was able to implement my feedback by incorporating silently.

Veronica was FA for TP. Audible, confident, and maintained eye contact, but not consistent economy of language.

Veronica was FA+ for CA; her example was in service to the objective and she conveyed accurate content and answered my question, she also pushed students who answered incorrectly to correct their responses (leaving out a squared after multiplying).  Veronica was FA for CD; her objective was clear to the students and she stated the focus of the lesson at the start, she used a model to teach and then attempted to check for understanding by having students work through a second model, which they did not complete.  Veronica was FA for ES; she engaged students in a limited way - there were only four students in the class, so all S participated, but each only one way, except for one student who also rolled a set of dice to set up the next problem.  

Veronica was FA+ for GACT because she offered feedback that improved her partner's directions.  Her initial directions included all parts of WTD and she attempted to incorporate my coaching feedback.  Veronica was FA+ for Reteach CT; her directions included multiple aspects of WTD and made sense in the context of the lesson. 

Veronica was highly rated by the prescreener and did not complete a phone interview; she has not flags and, thus, should be accepted.

During his teaching sample, he was confident and spoke at an appropriate tone and volume. However, he did frequently turn his back to the class to write on the board. He interpreted the objective correctly and his content was accurate. He did, however, spend too much time at the beginning of the lesson on extraneous content and details (but this did not keep him out of FA+ in Content Alignment). His lesson materials were logical and in service to the objective. The lesson objective was explicitly stated at the beginning of the lesson. He used a model to convey information, and he checked for understanding multiple times. He also asked students to support their answers (rather than just asking for correct answer, he asked for an explanation why). He engaged all students through a written worksheet and some note-copying. His lesson pace was steady, and most of the lesson was spent on the most important activities. During the group activity, Vito incorporated three aspects of WTD in a strong way. When giving feedback, he was able to give actionable feedback that improved his group members directions.

The candidate received an FA in CA because the interpretation of the lesson plan was logical and the examples used were clearly either a fact or an opinion. Candidate received an FA in ES because most of the students were engaged at least once during the lesson. Even though he gave the students an annotation strategy for identifying fact vs. opinion and had the students chorally read the definitions of opinion and fact. He received a FA in CD because the lesson was mostly linear and the materials were used to support mastery however the checks for understanding were  repetitive and superficially addressed fact vs. opinion. 

Group Activity: Vladamir was able to incorporate multiple components of WTD: ""turn to X page and pens on the Egypt paragraph"" ""You will read the paragraph silently and underline words like Egypt, and desert"" ""You will have pens down and eyes on me when you're done"" He was able to give strong feedback to the rest of the group and incorporate my feedback of giving his directions without the use of his notes.

Re-Teach: Based on what I remember Vladamir incorporated WTD but only impartially. He cold called on students to read the paragraphs and told other students so silently follow along. He also had a WTD when the students had to take their worksheets out but I remember that there were only 2 components incorporated.

Overall the TSPF was FA+. The candidate logically and appropriately completed the planning form about a lesson that is about literal and figurative language. The candidate included in detail what the teacher and students would be doing throughout the lesson. The candidate planned lesson activities that involved a text and were logically aligned to the objective. The CFU addresses the lesson objective and content. The candidate included essential information for the lesson that aligned to the objective. 

TP - FA. The candidate was somewhat confident for the majority of the lesson, but  he was also nervous at points and he was not engaging towards students. The candidate projected his voice so that everyone could hear him and he was formal the entire time. The candidate made eye contact with students often, but sometimes turned his back to students for 15 seconds at a time. The candidate rambled occasionally during the lesson to the point where it detracts from the content being presented. 

CA - FA. The candidate's interpretation of the provided objective was somewhat correct, but the candidate does not address the full objective. The candidate used some examples and activities that were logical and relate to the lesson objective. The candidate conveyed accurate content, but made a minor inaccuracy when he stated that both literal and figurative language can be used to be exactly how you feel without explaining the difference. The candidate's response to a question was accurate. 

CD - FA-. The lesson objective was clear to students and was stated at the beginning of the lesson. The candidate presented information in a way that impeded mastery and his key ideas were not clear. The candidate talked about the content, but did not model it. The candidate did not clearly define literal and figurative language. The candidate attempts to check for understanding by asking students to read sentences and identify figurative and literal language. He called on students and asked them to explain why.

ES - FA. The candidate purposefully engaged most participants at least once in the lesson by asking them to write answers to questions on a worksheet and calling on volunteers to answer and explain questions. The participation drove instruction forward slightly as it asked students to complete an academic task. The candidate gives students more than one way to participate (verbal and written). The candidate addressed questions quickly. 

MIT - FA. The lesson pace is generally steady and the candidate did not present a rushed finish. The candidate finished a few seconds early and used the last 30 seconds to review the material. The candidate does not refer to lesson notes and continues the lesson without pauses.

GA - FA. The candidate stayed on topic in the pair and appropriately participated in the planning for practice activity. The candidate's initial directions incorporated two components of WTD. The candidate incorporated some feedback from group members and selector, but with inaccuracies. 

RT - FA+. The candidate attempts to incorporate WTD directions though it is slightly imperfect. The candidate gave directions that were specific and concrete, then after students began added an observable. The candidate's WTD directions lead students toward completing an academic task.

Zachary is recommended to be selected in as he is FA+ in Critical Thinking and also scored FA+ in his group activity and reteach indicating that he can incorporate feedback and also give logical feedback as well. Candidate also came highly recommended. ",No cconcerns with previous application was withdrawn for not uploading transcripts,"prefers english but does not have a degree

All key points were aligned to the objective and clearly facilitate mastery of the objective, as she identifies a reading strategy that will help students master the objective. All content is explained in detail, including teacher and student actions. The planned lesson activities are logically aligned to the objective and facilitate student mastery. The planned CFU is logical and addresses the objective, but is not an informational text, as stated in the objective. During the teaching sample Zakia was consistently confident and used variation of tone to build engagement during the lesson. She spoke clearly and succinctly and maintained eye contact with students throughout the lesson, which led to an FA+ rating for TP. Her interpretation of the lesson objective was correct and the lesson addressed the full objective. She prioritized important content and avoided extraneous details. She conveyed accurate content and earned an FA rating for CA. The lesson objective was stated at the beginning of the lesson, so it was clear to students. She presented information linearly and used materials that supported mastery of the objective. She attempted a CFU, but assigned it as HW when her time ran out. She earned an Fa rating for CD and an FA for MIT as most of the lesson was spent on the most important activities to advance student understanding, but she presented a rushed finish when she eliminated the CFU. Zakia engaged all students in a written activity and gave most participants the opportunity to volunteer responses or answer questions when cold-called. She earned an FA+ rating for ES. During the GA Zakia stayed on topic and understood and appropriately participated in the planning for practice activity. Her initial planned direction incorporated three WTD components and her feedback to peers was logical and moved them to make their directions more specific. She earned an FA+ rating for the GA. During the re-teach Zakia accurately incorporated WTD directions that made sence in the context of her lesson. HEr directions moved students toward completing an academic task and she earned an FA+ rating for the re-teach. Zakia should be selected in and accepted to NYCTF for strong critical thinking overall and a strong teaching sample.",,"psych degree: 8/2016

His TSPF was the weakest part of the day - he was FA- for very generally filling out what students and teacher owuld be doing but including very little teacher or student detail.  In TP, he was very dynamic. He varied his tone, and showed strong confidence, projection, eye contact, and economy of lanugage. His TS on literal vs. figurative language required all students to read and identify language, and some students to resond in questions , but didthe other form of engagement was having students copy down a definition. He also had all students write a literal and/or figurative statement, so is E in ES. He completed all his activities and did not have waysted time so is E in MIT. In CA and CD, he is FA+, because everything was logical and aligned, but he did not identify particular skills students would use to identify the difference. During the GA, he included 3 components in his initial direciton, and gave logical glows and grows to his partners (although one of them was a repeat of another caniddate.)  He attempted, but did not do much to implement my feedback of economy of language, and his TSRT only featured one non-concrete direction, which was followed by him stopping his lesson 30 seconds before his two minutes was up, despite my clear directions not to do that. Overall though, with his strength in TP, and sufficient performance elsewhere, he is selected in and recommended. ",,"accounting degree to be conferred 12/2016

TSPF CT: FA+ Zuri's lesson was planned logically and appropriately, with clear alignment between the objective and key points, including student and teacher actions.  The activities throughout were logical and the CFU was logical for this objective.  Addtionally, the information included was essential for the lessona and the actions were explained in detail.  TP: E Zuri was confident throughout the lesson, using body language and her tone to build engagement.  She projected her voice at an appropriate volume and was formal, but warm.  She maintained eye contact and addressed her students throughout the lesson.  She employed EOL, focusing on the essential information to deliver her lesson.  CA: E Her interpretation of the objective was correct and she addressed it in its entirety, prioritizing the most important content and spending the entirety of the lesson focused on students mastery of her objective.  She used examples and activtiies that supported mastery and conveyed accurate information throughout the lesson.  CD: E Her objective was clear because she stated it and had a student read it aloud.  She used two models throughout the lesson to convey information and continually checked for understanding, having students apply the skill and justifying their answers with evidence.  Additionally, she constantly checked for understanding before she layered more information.  ES: E She purposefully engaged all students consistently throughout her lesson, asking them questions and having them answer, cold-calling, having them write to solve their equations, and choral response to move the activity forward.  She answered all questions that arose.  MIT: E The pacing was steady throughotu and she used time efficiently.  She presented a complete lesson within the timeframe allotted and the entirety of the lesson time was spent on the most important information.  GA CT: FA Zuri's initial instructions contained two of the four components of WTD.  She understood and participated appropriately in the activity and played the correct role.  She gave positive feedback that helped make one partner's WTD more sequential and was able to appropriately incorporate my feedback into her final revised instructions.  TSRT: FA+ Zuri used multiple instructions to get students focused and used one WTD instruction accurately to get them to complete an academic task.  Her instructions made sense within the context of the lesson and were appropriate within the context of the lesson.  ",Candidate reapplied because she was travelling last time around and her phone interview call got dropped. She has returned from her travels and has had no concerns.

Zybaida received an FA in TP. She spoke confidently throughout the lesson, maintained eye contact with her class, and project her volume at an appropriate and formal tone. She could have benefited from using economy of language in some of her explanation of material, specifically around the purpose of a venn diagram. In CA, she earned a FA+. Zybaida interprets the objective of identifying the similarities and differences between plants and animal cells correctly, as she has her students look at labeled images of a plant and animal cell and compare and contrast the time. The majority of the lesson is spent collecting information from the class through CFU questions to put in her model graphic organizer, which students copy down onto their worksheets. However, she does spend a large chunk of time talking generally about a venn-diagram (over one minute), rather than focusing on the objective itself.  In CD, Zybaida earned an FA+. She explained her objective to her students in the beginning of the lesson-- ""today, we'll be using a venn diagram today to find the similarities and differences in plant and animal cells."" She drew a model graphic organizer on the board that students then copied into their notes. Her checks for understanding were primarily having students volunteer answers to ""What is one similarity between a plant and animal cell?"" and ""what is one difference?"" She had one student support their answer with evidence-- ""how do you know that?""  In ES, Zybaida earned an FA. Zybaida's lesson primarily focused on call and response questions and copying notes from the board based on those answers. Students did not need to complete any other academic task aside from answering her CFU questions.  In MIT, Zybaida earned an FA. Her lesson was finished 45 seconds early, as the ending felt rushed and abrupt. After collecting 4 pieces of evidence for their venn-diagram, Zybaida's lesson was over, consistent with her TSPF. However, she does not refer to her notes at all throughout the lesson. 

During the GA, Zybaida seemed confused by the directions and revised the wrong scenario given to her. However, she was able to give feedback to her partner that improved the directions and made them more specific. She also partially applied my feedback to narrow down her numerous directions in her revision, by focusing on what students should be doing now, as opposed to later in the lesson. During her TS RT, Zybaida used two components of WTD-- specific and observable in her directions, but could've used it more frequently and consistently in other areas where she gave directions to the class, Overall, Zybaida is a strong candidate and should be accepted to NYCTF.
