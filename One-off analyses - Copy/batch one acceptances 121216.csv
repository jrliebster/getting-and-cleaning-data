During the teaching sample, her TP was FA+. She was confident throughout the lesson and her actions and tone were engaging.  When answering questions, she was encouraging to the students.  Her TSO was FA+ due to a strength in ES (FA+).  Most students answered questions and all students were engaged in using a worksheet to draw the parts of the atom.  Her attempt at a CFU was to have the students draw the Nitrogen atom, but she did not model how to do this, she talked about a diagram of a different atom. Therefore, the CFU was not aligned to all parts of the objective and the model was unclear. (CD- FA and CA FA).  Her MIT was also FA.  She did not prioritize the time correctly, she spent too much time discussing her diagram and did not leave enough time for the students to be engaged in the content, the lesson had a rushed finish.

Kristina earned an FA on her TSPF. The key points and activities were aligned to the objective. In pairs/groups, there is a CFU in which students determine if a sentence contains literal or figurative language, however, the TSPF does not include a CFU at the closing of the lesson. 

Kristina earned an E on her TS. Kristina's TP was FA+ because she projected her voice, maintained eye contact with students and demonstrated confidence in interacting with the class. She lost economy of language when answering questions, which kept her out of E. With respect to CA, Kristina was also FA+. She conveyed accurate content at all times and all activities and questions were in service to the objective. Since Kristina's TS lacked independent practice, the lesson was unable to gauge individual student mastery. In terms of ES, Kristina was FA+. She engaged all students once by having them work with a partner to determine whether a sentence contained figurative or literal language. She also cold called students and took volunteers, which allowed most students another opportunity to participate. In terms of CD, Kristina used a model to demonstrate the differences between literal and figurative language, asked students to explain the examples she provided and stated the objective clearly at the beginning of her TS. As a CFU, students were asked to determine whether a sentence contained figurative or literal language and when they shared answers at the closing of the lesson, she asked students to justify their answers. She was therefore E in CD.

During the GA, Kristina's initial WTD directions incorporated 3 components of WTD. She was able to give feedback that helped improve her partner's directions and accurately incorporated feedback from staff.

Group Activity: During the Group Activity Mikhail was able to demonstrate multiple components of WTD directions, and was able to provide actionable feedback to the group, especially to Nathan. The reason why he is an FA+ and not an E is that when I gave him the feedback of saying his directions in less words, he has the habit of repeating things or saying filler words when he may not know what to say (maybe a nervous habit) but it hindered his ability to actually complete the feedback. 

Reteach: Mikhail received an FA in the Re Teach because he was able to incorporate WTD, however his economy of language and at times poor choice of directions lead him to have an FA. He would give multiple unnecessary observables like thumbs up, after they were already looking at him. ",,"prefers math but missing calc

TP: FA+
During Jennifer's TS, she was consistently confident and attempted to be engaging by varying her tone. Her voice was appropriately loud and clear, and she was mostly consistent in facing the class, although she read off her notes from time to time. She was mostly succinct--although she occasionally lost economy of language, she recovered quickly from these moments and moved forward with her lesson. FA+
CA: FA+
She interpreted the objective of determining author's purpose correctly, and her lesson addressed the full objective. All content conveyed was accurate, including her response to the selector's question, and her text excerpts and questions were in service to the objective.
CD: FA+
The objective was explicitly stated, and she used oral examples as a model for each of the three author's purposes. Her CFU included having students apply the skill by identifying purpose in 2 texts and providing their own examples.
ES: FA
Most candidates were engaged at least once by responding to questions, and students were also asked to circle whether a text was informative, persuasive, or entertaining, although this did not necessarily lead to students actually engaging.
MIT: FA
The lesson pace was generally steady, although she had to cut part of an activity to finish on time and then slowed down slightly toward the end.

During the group activity, Jennifer participated actively and enthusiastically. Unfortunately, her initial proposed direction did not demonstrate an understanding of the technique (""I notcied you are not ready. Thumbs up if you need further directions""). She was somewhat confused about the feedback portion and needed directions repeated several times, although this may have been due to nerves. Her feedback to her partners was logical, though they did not necessarily improve the activity. She was able to incorporate feedback from the selector. FA-

During her TSRT, Jennifer incorporated some elements of WTD, although this was imperfect--she had different elements for different parts of the lesson (an observable for taking out the worksheet, concrete/specific for identifying author's purpose). FA

Overall, Jennifer was an enthusiastic participant with a solid teacher presence. However, there were moments of concern throughout the event, in particular with critical thinking. Her re-teach was imperfect, although she did have some elements of WTD, but her performance in the group activity was weak, leaving me in some doubt as to her understanding of the technique.

In terms of CT she was rated FA+ due to an FA+ in GA and the reteach.

In terms of CT during the GA she was rated FA+.  She was able to appropriately participate in the planning for practice activity and followed all directions.  Also, she was able break down the WTD directions in a clear and logical manner.  Her initial proposed directions included concrete, sequential, and observable.  Her feedback to her partner, was specific, for example she stated, ""Pencils up when ready to copy the definitions from the board,"" would make sense in terms of a logical observable directions to help them start copying.  This suggestion helped improve her partner’s directions.  Her revised directions accurately incorporated my feedback.  For example, I told her to make finding the title more concrete, tell students exactly what to do to complete the task .  In response she stated, ""point to the title that is underlined at the top of the page...""  Overall she demonstrated the ability to learn a new skill and apply that learning in a clear and logical manner.

Second, in terms of the reteach she was rated FA+.  She accurately incorporated the WTD directions and my feedback into her reteach.  For example, my written grow was to tell the students how to complete the handout and she stated, ""pick up your pencil and point to the first blank space on the bottom left.  Once you have found it thumbs up.  Copy the information from the board exactly as I write on on your sheet.""  This demonstrated a clear understanding of the feedback and the ability to interpret the information clearly.  Finally her WTD directions made sense in the context of her lesson and lead students toward successfully completing an academic task.  For example, she stated ""If you are ready thumbs up.

Overall she was able to incorporate WTD directions in most parts of the lesson where appropriate.  

Her TSPF was rated FA.  She included mostly clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  Her directions were step by step and included a student activity of students arranging the plot points of a story.  She also included a logical check for student understanding using a recap at the end.  Most of her key points are aligned to her objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained and were relevant to the learning objective.

In terms of TS she was rated FA with an FA- in MIT.

In terms of MIT she was rated FA- due to a lesson pace that was mis-allocated on activities.  For example, she spent the first 2 minutes defining the 5 stages of story plot then had the students work on a handout for almost one minute and thirty seconds where there was no instruction or teacher actions.  Hence she finished the lesson rushed as she tried to share the responses in the last minute.

He was FA in CT and TSO, and had some relative weaknesses in CA. The spike in TP was significant, as his TP was also strong in the RT even though he was nervous. There was no phone interview to evaluate. 

The TSPF is completed logically and appropriately and key points are aligned to the chosen objective. The CFU is logical and aligned and teacher and student actions are also explained. However, the TSPF lacks detail. Student practice in the form of group work is evident throughout. The TP in this lesson is FA+, as there were strengths in econ of language and the candidate attempted to be engaging in tone throughout. He also maintained eye contact with the class and used a formal tone. He was confident when teaching and didn't appear to be nervous at all. The objective asked students to draw an atom, and that was part of the candidates worksheet but he did not ask the students to actually draw one, so there is misalignment there. Most of the content is therefore misaligned- he asked students to complete a worksheet and then reviewed true/false questions from the worksheet. His response to my question was accurate, and there were no errors in what he was teaching. The content was not quite extraneous, he just didn't ask the right questions to get to the objective. His explanation was also slightly confusing to participants but logical for the content in that students could not make connections between what they were asked to do and the content taught- the worksheets were not aligned to the minilesson. CD, however, was a strength because the candidate shared the objective explicitly with students and the CFU asked students to apply info about atoms, but he did not use a model. There was significant questioning and materials were connected to content, and the CFU partially addressed the objective- but still, students did not have to draw an atom. Students worked together in a group to complete their worksheets in writing, and he called on students to share responses to the worksheet. There was also one choral response during the lesson and he asked for volunteers when introducing the objective. All questions were addressed. In MIT, the pace of the lesson was steady and the candidate did not refer to notes during the lesson. Most of the time was spent on content and student work and all activities were completed so MIT is FA+. Overall, there were a variety of strengths and weaknesses in the TS. During the GA, Jeremy was FA. While he was able to support his colleagues and participated in the activity correctly, his feedback was mostly positive and he did not incorporate my feedback to use fewer words accurately. He did have some FA+ evidence in that he was able to include three components of WTD in his initial directions. In the RT, Jeremy's WTD directions were slightly imperfect- he asked students to do something ""quietly"" and asked for eyes on me, but they made sense in context. They did not move students towards completing an academic task and there were missed opportunities. Overall, he meets the bar for FA.",,Bio Imm only. No other science classes ,3.046,2.5-2.74

In terms of CT he was rated FA+ due to FA+ in TSPF and the GA.  

First, his TSPF was rated FA+.  He included clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  His directions were step by step and included a student activity of students reading a story and identifying literal and figurative language.  He also included a logical check for student understanding using questions at the end of the lesson.   All of his key points are aligned to his objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.

Second, in terms of CT during the GA he was rated FA+.  He was able to appropriately participate in the planning for practice activity and followed all directions.  Also, he was able break down the WTD directions in a clear and logical manner.  His initial proposed directions included concrete, sequential, and observable.  His feedback to his partner, was specific, for example he stated, ""tell them to point to the title, you can name the title.""  This suggestion helped improve his partner’s directions.  His revised directions accurately incorporated my feedback.  For example, I told him to make copy from the board more concrete, tell students exactly what they should do.  In response he stated, ""when you begin coping lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.""  Overall he demonstrated the ability to learn a new skill and apply that learning in a clear and logical manner.
 
In terms of TP he was rated FA+.  He exhibited an ease, poise, and self-assurance with his interactions with the class.  He also demonstrated a confidence in his interactions.  He projected his voice and used both formal and informal tone depending on the part of the class.  In addition his tone was at an appropriate volume.  He maintained eye contact with the students and was always facing the class.  Finally, he spoke succinctly and clearly throughout the lesson and displayed instances of economy of language. 

In terms of TS he was rated FA+ due to E rating in CA and FA+ in ES, CD, and MIT.

In terms of CA he was rated E.  Overall he presented a teaching sample that was in service to his stated learning objective. First, his interpretation of the objective was correct and the lesson addressed the objective in full for example he stated the learning objective at the start and reviewed it at the end of the lesson.  Second, he prioritized the content of and spent all of the time on what was most important for mastery of the objective. For example, after he defined the terms he had students identify the terms in 2 stories.  Third, he used materials- his handout, examples-in his speech, and activities- having students read a story and identify literal and figurative in service of the objective.  Also, during the lesson he conveyed accurate content at all times.  Finally he demonstrated the ability to analyze and interpret information accurately. 

In terms of CD he was rated FA+.  Overall he facilitated understanding through his delivery.  First he clearly communicated the objective of the lesson to the students for example after he stated the definition students wrote it on their handout.   He used a model to clearly convey information for example he used a handout with 2 stories and asked students to underline figurative language.  Also, he had a check of understanding by asking the students to answer questions and share their responses.  Overall his lesson broke the content into smaller pieces and his presentation was clear and logical, this was a very well planned and executed lesson.

In terms of ES he was rated FA+.  His lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  He purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example he had students answer questions, identify literal and figurative in stories, read a story, write definitions, and respond to his questions.  These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, he gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example through reading, writing, and verbal answers.  He also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students underline figurative meaning in the story.  During the lesson he cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall he intentional engaged all the students throughout his lesson.

In terms of MIT he was rated FA+ his lesson had a steady pace and he finished his lesson in time, getting through all of his activities.  Also, much of the time was spent on the most important activities to advance student understanding.

Veronica was FA for TP. Audible, confident, and maintained eye contact, but not consistent economy of language.

Veronica was FA+ for CA; her example was in service to the objective and she conveyed accurate content and answered my question, she also pushed students who answered incorrectly to correct their responses (leaving out a squared after multiplying).  Veronica was FA for CD; her objective was clear to the students and she stated the focus of the lesson at the start, she used a model to teach and then attempted to check for understanding by having students work through a second model, which they did not complete.  Veronica was FA for ES; she engaged students in a limited way - there were only four students in the class, so all S participated, but each only one way, except for one student who also rolled a set of dice to set up the next problem.  

Veronica was FA+ for GACT because she offered feedback that improved her partner's directions.  Her initial directions included all parts of WTD and she attempted to incorporate my coaching feedback.  Veronica was FA+ for Reteach CT; her directions included multiple aspects of WTD and made sense in the context of the lesson.

However, it lacked detail about teacher and student actions. During the TS, Derron stated the objective in the beginning and then explained the definitions of the three types of writing. He did not model how to determine the purpose of the text. He went straight into having the students read a passage and determine the purpose. Derron's interpretation of the objective was correct. He used materials that were in service to the objective, conveyed accurate content at all times, and  had a CFU. His CA was FA+ and his CD was FA. Derron's TP was FA.  He was confident. However, his interactions were not necessarily engaging. He projected his voice at an appropriate volume and made eye contact consistently. Derron engaged students at least once (took volunteers) but did not give more than one way to participate. Derron finished his TS 25 seconds early but was still FA for MIT.  During the GA, Derron incorporated two components of WTD directions in his initial revised directions - he was specific and had an observable.  When Derron gave feedback to his partner, he said only positive things and sat in silence for 30 sec until his partner asked him what he can do better. With this prompt Derron then told his partner to be more specific. Next, Derron accurately incorporated the feedback from me which was to be more specific. He added that that students should complete the task silently. Still though, Derron was FA for GA. During the re-teach, Derron incorporated WTD directions in one part of the lesson and it demonstrated an understanding of the technique. He was specific about what to do and told the students to complete the task silently and gave an observable at the end. He only used WTD directions once in the TS re-teach. Derron was FA+ for the re-teach. Overall, Derron is a good candidate for NYCTF and should be accepted in. He met or exceeded the model in all parts of the selection.  ","Derron has a very low GPA - 2.5 in undergrad - but successfully completed a graduate degree with over a 3.0. He also is a previous applicant. He applied in 2016 and received a Highly Recommend in Prescreening, but then was withdrawn for not submitting materials.

The objective was interpreted correctly, and his examples and activities were logically aligned to the objective of determining absolute location using latitude and longitude. All materials and handouts were in service to the objective, and content conveyed was accurate.
CD: FA+
The objective was explicitly stated at the beginning of the lesson. Jesse provided a model of how to find NYC before asking students to engage in the work independently. There was an attempt at a CFU, although this could have been stronger if he had asked students to explain how they got their answers.
ES: FA+
All students were engaged independently in the academic task of locating countries using latitude and longitude. All students were engaged by reading definitions aloud and/or sharing out answers.
MIT: FA+
The lesson was generally steady, although it slowed slightly during the independent practice. He finished exactly on time, and the lesson time was appropriately allocated.

TSO: FA+

During the group activity, Jesse's initial proposed directions were sequential, specific, concrete, and observable. He gave logical feedback to his partners (e.g., did not have an observable outcome).

During the group activity, she included all four components of WTD, so her feedback from me was focused around a higher level skill. She provided feedback to group members that was actionable and improved the quality of their directions.

He maintained eye contact, however when he modeled his lesson his back was turned for longer than 15 seconds at a time. He spoke succinctly and had a formal tone throughout the lesson. He maintained economy of language. He did not earn an FA+ because there was no variation of tone to engage the students. Joseph earned an FA- in TSO because he received an FA- in ES as well as CA. He really only allowed for one way for students to participate in the lesson, letting the same 2-3 students answer his call and response questions. There was no writing or reading that the students had to do, so since not everyone participated at least once he received an FA-. He received an FA- in Content Alignment because his model  was confusing in terms of how to find the area of a triangle. He somehow dissected a circle and turned it into a rectangle but did not do a good job of explaining how you turn a circle into a rectangle He eventually got to the point where he found the area but how he got from Point A to Point B was unclear. 

Group Activity: Candidate was by far the strongest in this activity from the group. He was able to incorporate all 4 components and give actionable feedback to the Fellow candidates so that they were able to improve their directions, like telling a candidate to be more specific about where the students should start reading.  

Re-Teach: Joseph received an FA in his Re-Teach because he didn't apply  WTD directions in multiple parts of his re-teach. His direction also did not lead them to complete an academic activity, as the direction was simply to take out their worksheets and follow along. He did incorporate two components of WTD, however they were slightly imperfect as it was a poor choice of the ""concrete"" domain and no clear observable directions. 

Please review: Joseph seemed to know his content well, despite the fact that he presented it in a confusing way and his GA and CT skills were by far the best of the day. He also received an E in his TSPF. Based on these strengths, please review to see if this is a waiting list or other alternatives for Joseph's candidacy. ","QC Select Out but FA or above in TP, CTO, TSO; also two FA- in TSO. Based on Alyssa's notes, he should have a FA- in TSO. However, she also selected ""Please Review"" and upon reviewing, I believe she rated too stringently on Engages Students. Based on her evidence of ES, not everyone participated, but most did. I am changing this rating to FA, and therefore, Joseph's overall score for TSO is FA. He is therefore selected-in because of his spiked ratings in CTO.

Nichol earned an FA+ on the TSPF. The activities were logical, aligned and described in some detail. The final CFU however was slightly misaligned to the objective. The objective was to distinguish fact from opinion in an informational text, however the closing CFU asks students to come up with their own facts and opinions. 

Nichol earned an FA+ in TP. She projected her voice, maintained eye contact and was confident in her interactions with the class. She did not, however consistently demonstrate economy of language. 

Overall Nichol was FA+ in ES. She engaged all students once in an activity in which they read sentences and determined if they were fact or opinion. She also asked for volunteers and cold called one student, which meant that she engaged most students in more than one way. With respect to CD Nichol used a model to teach the differences between fact and opinion, had students apply the skill on several examples and asked for their reasoning. At the closing, she read aloud a paragraph and had students identify facts and opinions within and explain their answers. She was therefore E in CD as she used CFU multiple times. In terms of CA, Nichol was FA+ because the materials were logical given the objective, content was accurate, and activities were aligned to the objective. Nichol earned an FA+ in MIT because she had to adjust timing at the end of her TS to begin work on the CFU. 

In the GA, Nichol's initial directions met all four components of WTD, she gave feedback that improved her partner's directions and she was able to incorporate staff feedback. She therefore earned an E.

In the TSRT, Nichol delivered 3 WTD directions that met at least 3 components of the skill. She used the WTD directions to set students to work on an academic task and drive instruction forward.

Karen scored a FA in TP. She seemed confidant but her interactions were not engaging as she did not interact with students. She spoke very clearly and maintained a formal tone. Karen scored a FA in CA because she did address the full objective which was ""identify the parts and steps of human respiration."" Karen labeled all parts of the respiratory system but was unable to explain any steps during the process. However, she conveyed correct content when labeling her model. Karen was a FA in CD because she had a model of the respiratory system and attempted to check for understanding. However, during her check for understanding, Karen pointed to the correct answer before asking the question and was only able to ask 1 student a question without providing an answer. Lastly, she was a FA in ES because she engaged all participants by having them label their worksheet. However, when she cold called students she told them the answer so she did not push academic thinking for students. Lastly, Karen was a FA in MIT because he pace was steady. Karen took close to 2 minutes to set up her poster and finished the lesson a few minutes early. During the group activity (FA+), Karen provided a glow and a grow for her partner's and included three components of WTD directions. She could have made her direction more specific. She also stayed on topic in the pair. During the reteach (FA), Karen delivered one WTD direction and then missed several opportunities to say a WTD (labeling the rest of the model). Through the interview, Karen was professional and had clear communication skills.

She was confident but not engaging during the lesson. She projected her voice appropriate. She did not display much economy of language, especially during my question which earned her the FA. She earned FA in CA. Her interpretation of the objective is correct but she did not provide clear instruction and definitions for main idea and supporting details. Her materials and activities were logical though. She earned an FA+ in CD because the objective was clear, there was a model and she checked for understanding. She earned an FA+ in ES because all students wrote in the CFU on the back of the sheet and most participated verbally by answering questions. She earned an E in MIT for finishing exactly on time. She earned an FA+ in the TS overall.

Jesslyn earned an FA+ in CT for the group activity. She gave constructive feedback and incorporated two components of WTD. She successfully incorporated my feedback by specifying that students should take notes in the vocabulary section of their notebooks. She earned an FA in the reteach because her WTD was imperfect. There was a clear attempt with an observable and some specific directions for how many supporting details to underline but there was no WTD beyond that single direction. Overall her CT was an FA+ due to the spike from the group activity.

Jesslyn does meet the bar and should be admitted to the program.

In TP Ari scored an FA+. He was confident through out the lesson and he projected his voice with an appropriate tone. He observed economy of language at some points. In CA he scored a FA-. He provided many examples and modeled many examples of figurative meaning but neglected to spend time on the literal definition of words or phrases and to identify them. He used logical examples but the literal meaning of the examples in the first set of text was somewhat confusing. He conveyed accurate content about what the figurative meaning of words are (different than the literal interpretation of words). In CD he scored an FA+. The lesson objective is clear to participants. He used materials that supported mastery of the objective (an article and poem). He attempted to CFU and he asked students for evidence why the terms were literal and figurative. In ES he scored an FA+. Some sutudents raised their hand to share an answer. All students analyzed the poem on their paper. In MIT he scored an FA. He presented a completed lesson but he ended the lesson about 15 seconds early. 

In the TSPF Ari scored an FA+. Planned activities of analyzing text seems to address the objective. Teacher action and student action seem to be explained in detial. Some of the content (key points) does not directly align to identifying the difference between the literal and figurative mean in of text. She stated ""Figurative language helps strengthen an author’s point. Using figurative language enables authors to voice their creativity while making a point""

In the GA Ari scored an FA+ in the GA. He provided feedback to his partner to be more specific about where they should put the materials and be specific about where their notebook and pen could be. In the direction he presented to me he included all elements and he questioned the feedback the group gave (should I include another time??). He suggested to his partner to be specific about what thumb to put up and what finger to put on the heading. In the direction he presented to me.

She had a student read the objective and asked some students questions - ""why did you stand at 'resolution' instead of conflict?""  Montana was a E in ES because she had all students complete the do now and stand up to show the part of their story on the plot. She also cold called 4 students. Montana was a FA+ in CA because she used activities that were aligned and relevant - had students identify part of a text to determine the part of the plot. Lastly, she was a FA in MIT because her pace was steady and she ended the lesson with 20 seconds left. She also spent most of the lesson having students determine the part of the plot. During the group activity (FA), Montana proposed directions included all 4 parts of WTD directions however she struggled to provided a glow and a grow for each partner. However, her feedback was concrete and specific. For example, she told a partner to be more specific about which group he wanted the students to get into (reading group, writing group, etc). During the reteach (FA+), Montana included a strong WTD direction and directed students to stand up and go to a location at the board. Her direction included all four parts of WTD directions. During the interview, Montana was professional and had clear communication skills. I recommend that Montana is accepted to NYCTF due to her strong TP and TSO scores.

She had two components of WTD initially and she was able to apply my feedback. She did need to make her directions more concrete so this keeps her out of E. She earned an FA+ in the reteach because her directions accurately incorporated WTD and it did move students toward completing the academic task with the wheel. She earned an FA- on her TSPF because there was a lot of extraneous information in her lesson plan and the activities seemed illogical. This was not the case in the actual lesson. She earned an FA in CT overall.

Based on her performance today, Taina should be admitted to the program. ",,"speech pathology degree conferred 9/2016

His TS overall was FA. He demonstrated strengths in incorporating WTD directions both in the GA and in the RT. 

Omar's TP in the TS was FA. He was confident, but his interactions lacked engagement. He projected his voice, and maintained a formal tone. His CA was FA. Omar did address the objective, however, the majority of the time was spent going over the definitions of the different elements of plot, and thus the students did not have much time to apply the 5 stages of plot. He gave them 20 seconds to discuss the five stages to a movie of their choosing. CD is FA. Candidate used a clear model, which was a model of the plot diagram with the definitions, but his check for understanding was partial as the students did not have sufficient time to apply the plot diagram. ES was FA. All participants were asked to turn and talk to a partner to discuss the plot elements of a movie of their choosing, however, there was only one way in which the candidates were invited to participate in the lesson, and that was verbally.  During the GA, Omar offered feedback to help improve another candidate's directions. He incorporated three elements of WTD. He also incorporated feedback. The RT was FA. During the RT, Omar incorporated one attempt at WTD directions, but there were other places in the lesson during which he could have incorporated WTD.

The CFU addresses the content but does not assess the whole objective (i.e., asks students to define main idea and details, rather than identify). FA

TP: FA+
During her TS, Nelifa was confident and attempted to be engaging. She was warm and friendly while still keeping her tone formal, her voice was appropriately projected, and she maintained eye contact throughout the lesson.
CA: FA
The objective was intepreted correctly, and the lesson addressed the full objective, although there were minor inaccuracies (e.g., a theme is the same thing as the main idea) that did not necessarily interfere with instruction.
CD: FA
The objective was explicitly stated to the class. The informationw was presented linearly and mostly lecture style, although the lesson could have benefited from a model. She attempted to CFU by having students work on an example, although she gave them the answer.
ES: FA
All students copied from the board, and some students responded to questions about main idea and supporting details.
MIT: FA
The lesson pace was generally steady although it was a bit slow. She finished less than a minute early.
TSO: FA

During the group activity, Nelifa's initial proposed directions were sequential and observable, with some elements of specific (although the direction ""discuss"" could have been more concrete). Her feedback was somewhat uneven (""more specific about where to find key words"" was good but then told another partner to add encouragement to the direction). She incorporated selector feedback with accuracy. FA+

During her TSRT, Nelifa's WTD directions were specific, concrete, sequential, and observable. She used the direction multiple times throughout the lesson, sometimes toward an academic task. FA+

Throughout the event, Nelifa participated with enthusiasm and professionalism, with a strong teacher presence. Her teaching sample was borderline, but her participation in the group activity and her performance in the RT indicated an understanding of the WTD technique and strong critical thinking.

Cary was FA for TP, she was audible, confident, and engaging in her initial TS, but less so in her Reteach.  She mostly maintained eye contact, only turning to write on board.  

Cary was E for CA; her content was aligned, correct, and her examples were accurate.  She expanded upon her response to m question by including further information.  Cary was FA+ for CD; she clearly stated her objective, presented information linearly, asking S to help her with examples before adding her own and then ending with having S identify text samples and explain why (CFA).   Cary was FA+ for ES; all students were engaged at least once in at least one of the following ways: cold call or identifying example, and all were engaged with a choral response at the end (but this choral response did not drive academic instruction, it was really a reading).  Cary was FA for MIT, she wrapped up a little earlier than she needed to and could've asked one more question, but she was fully FA.     

Cary was FA for GACT; her initial direction included multiple components of WTD and she applied my coaching FB.  Her feedback to  others was less helpful, although she tried, and there were brief moments where she was confused by the activity.  Overall she had mixed evidence for this portion but appears to meet the bar for FA overall.

She wrote a great TSPF and gave an exemplary re-teach which shows an understanding of WTD.  Annakaye has to learn to not go overboard though, which did not help with her TSOR.  Her TSPF was packed with activities that could not be done in the amount of time and her MIT, and CA did suffer as a result.  Annakaye could not adjust for this during her lesson.  Despite these imperfections, I strongly believe Annakaye can learn how to improve these aspects, and would make a great fit in NYCTF.  She already has the necessary critical thinking skills which will aide in her ability to learn from her coaches and lead instructor.",,"pref: ENL, English, sped, sped English, sped SS

Alex was very strong in his teaching sample overall.  Alex demonstrated a keen understanding how how to prepare a TSPF and how to deliver the content and engage the students.  Alex is a paraprofessional and has spent a lot of time in the classroom and so he understands these specific components.  What Alex lacks mostly is the critical thinking component, in comparison to his teaching sample.  Alex exhibits a lack of understanding of WTD which was apparent when his initial WTD in his GA did not even match the goal result of the WTD in the practice scenario.  However, after receiving feedback from peers, and listening to everyone else, he did change his WTD to fit more with the scenario during his revision.  Moreover, the fact that he did implement a component or two of WTD in his re-teach shows that he did retain something, but it also reinforced his true lack of understanding.  Based on his E on TSOR and the fact that there are signs of an ability to learn critical thinking, I believe with help during PST, Alex would be capable of learning the skills to be an effective teacher.  As such, I believe Alex should be accepted.",,"pref: English, math, science, sped, d75, sped English, sped SS

Throughout selection day, Mayla was confident, kind, and prepared. She presented as professional, gave feedback to her peers and took feedback well with no pushback. Mayla expressed herself clearly throughout the day and asked questions when she needed clarification. 

Overall the TSPF was FA. The teacher planned a lesson on teaching the main idea and supporting details on an informational text. In the TSPF, the key points were aligned to the chosen objective and the candidate logically completed the entire form. The candidate detailed what the teacher would be doing, but not what students would be doing. The planned lesson activities are logically aligned to the objective. The candidate planned to CFU through questioning and restating what the main idea and supporting details were. 

Mayla's teaching sample was rated overall FA. She was rated FA+ in the majority of the categories, but ran out of time and did not allow for independent practice or a summary of the lesson at the end causing her to receive an FA- in MIT. 
TP - FA+. The candidate was confident for the majority of the lesson and projected her voice loudly enough so that all students could hear. The candidate's tone was warm, but not always formal. The candidate made eye contact will all students and never turned her back tot he students. The candidate spoke succinctly when teaching, but lost economy of language when answering questions and explaining her tree metaphor.

She earned an FA+ in CA (lesson activities were aligned, info was accurate, answer to my Q was a little hard to understand), an FA in ES (all S answered at least one Q aloud, but no other way for S to participate in the lesson), FA in CD (obj was clear, model was used, but CFU did not cover the entire obj -- S did not ID stages of plot in a story, but defined them). Thus, she was FA in TSO.

During the GA, she drafted directions that did not focus on the goal of having S discuss their answers (she mostly focused on how to get the HW out for discussion). She attempted to give fdbk to her partners, but it wasn't always clear or logical. She was open to fdbk from me and attempted to incorporate it into her direction, but not totally in a logical way. Thus, she was FA in GA CT.

During the TSR, she spent a majority of her 2:00 going over the material for her lesson, and did not incorporate WTD until the end. Her direction attempted some components of obs and concrete. Thus, she was FA in CT and FA in CTO.

She received an FA- in CA. The activities were mostly aligned however she repeatedly stated an inaccurate detail that would eventually lead to  inaccuracies in the student work. She stated the ""doctor stating that the panda is fine"" is a fact because a doctor said it. However, even though a doctor is qualified to make an assessment, it is an expert's opinion, not a fact. 
Group Activity: Magdalene was able to make her directions very sequential, specific and concrete. However, economy of language is still an issue for her. Even after I gave her the feedback of saying her directions in less words, her directions were entirely too wordy. She also said them in a speed that was too fast for me to write down fully.

Unless she was asking a question specifically to a student, she was either looking down, or at her paper. Her voice was loud enough to hear generally, but did get low/mumbled at points. Kiara's TSO is an FA+ because she engaged all students at least once, having them write down the main idea, supporting details of a text on a graphic organizer. She also had students either participate by either reading from the text or answering a question verbally. She received an FA in CD because her model and delivery was very linear. Students read their paragraphs and answered the questions. The checks for understanding required the students to both identify and explain why. Received an FA in CA because she didn't state why exactly the the first and last sentence of a paragraph or typically important in fictional pieces (the topic sentence and where the claim/thesis/main idea would typically be.

Group Activity: Kira was able strong in providing feedback, even though she told one candidate to give a more clear observable, that candidate was fairly soft spoken and was going to receive the same feedback from the other candidates as well. She was able to incorporate my feedback of giving a new observable and had multiple components of WTD: 3 minutes makes it sequential, problem 1 makes it specific, face front makes it observable, and it was overall sequential. She also incoporated my feedback. The only thing that's keeping her from an E is that the feedback she gave. 

Re-Teach: Re-teach received a FA+ in ReTeach because she incorporated at least 3 components: she had an observable, was able to give a time limit and they were sequential but they weren't completely specific, ""work on the next 3 problems."" Once she gave her directions she just sort of stood there waiting out her time. What they do after they give their directions and the students do an independent activity is not necessarily on the rubric so I  did not penalize her for that. Therefore she received a FA+.

The candidate is a Select Out because of what she received in her TP.

The TSPF is completed logically and appropriately with the key points logically and appropriately aligned to the objective.

The check for understanding is completely aligned to the chosen objective as teacher asks students to explain what parallel structure is, and to use it to complete a sentence. Eden began the lesson very confidently and attempted to be engaging.  She stated the lesson objective so that students are fully aware of the lesson objective for the day.  She uses a clear model that is clear to help convey what parallel structure is to students.  She does use check for understandings, and constantly asks students what the purpose of the parallelism is.  Therefore she is also asking students to support their findings.  Eden engaged each student at least once. She asked for students to volunteer answers, support their answers and gave students an opportunity to underline and identify parallelism in the model she provided them with.  Eden spent the entire lesson prioritizing the most important content and used materials and examples that were in service of the objective.  The first example required students to identify parallelism in a series of sentences.  The next example required students to fill in a blank to make sure the sentence is completed using parallel structure.  Eden maximized instructional time, as the lesson maintained a steady pace. She did make adjustments to ensure she had time to summarize.  During the group activity, Eden stayed on task and remained focus.  She incorporated all components of WTD during her initial revised directions and when she incorporated group member feedback.  She clearly incorporated selector feedback and maintained all components of WTD.  She gave feedback to group members using the feedback cheat sheet and even gave specific ways for her group members to improve their directions.

The chosen objective is, students will be able to distinguish between literal and figurative language in a text and determine the meaning of each. The form is completed logically and appropriately and the key points listed are clearly and appropriately aligned to the chosen objective. Student and teacher actions are listed but in uneven detail.  Teacher actions are scripted clearly, however student actions lack detail consistently throughout in some places on the TSPF.  There is a clear check for understanding that is only partly aligned to the objective, as the teacher will ask students the definition of literal and figurative language, but does not require them to distinguish between these two in a text.  Alexis begins the lesson confidently and definitely used a variety of tones to be engaging throughout the teaching sample.  Alexis interprets the objective almost fully, however, she does not use a text to help students distinguish between figurative and literal language. She used a series of sentences.  Despite this, the entire lesson focused on distinguishing between literal and figurative language and what the meaning of each is.  Each time a student responded to a question, Alexis required that they explain how they know, or why is the answer they chose correct.  Alexis engaged every student except one student at least once.  She primarily relied on student volunteers, but did cold call on one student.  Students were required to underline figurative words and circle literal words on the worksheet as an additional form of engagement.  Alexis maximized her instructional time, as the lesson was not rushed, had a steady pace and she spent the most time continually checking for student understanding by having them support all answers with evidence.  During the group activity, Alexis stayed on topic and was focused. She gave glow and grows from the feedback cheat sheet to each of her group members and even suggested ways in which group members could improve their directions.  She was a high performing candidate with what to do directions that included all the components, so selector feedback was to eliminate the use of notes.  She incorporated this feedback flawlessly. During the re-teach, Alexis used these WTD, ""Eyes up at me, pick up pencils and look down at your worksheets.  You will have thirty seconds to silently read questions 1-3. I want you to underline the literal examples and circle the figurative examples. I want you to put your pencils down and give me a thumbs up so that I know that you are finished.""

During the lesson, her tone was formal and she spoke loudly enough for the students to hear. She mostly made eye contact with the class; however, when getting materials, she had her back to the students for nearly 10 seconds. Michele's CA was FA. Michele focuses on the most essential information during the lesson. She uses examples and activities that relate to the three types of rocks.  When she was speaking about ""metamorphic rocks"", she was saying ""metaphoric"" which could impede a student's understanding of the key concepts. Michele's CD was FA+.  She used a model to clearly convey the information. She also stated the learning objective after using questioning to activate prior knowledge. While reviewing the lesson, Michele required students to support their responses with academic evidence.  Michele's ES was FA+.  She engaged all students at least once during the lesson and gave them more than one way to respond through cold-calling, written responses (a worksheet), index card responses (show your card), and volunteering. Students also were asked to explain another student's response. Michele's MIT was FA. Throughout the lesson, she referred to her notes but did not stop her lesson.  Michele's overall teaching sample is FA+. During the group activity, Michele's initial directions accurately incorporated three components of the WTD directions. She received feedback to make specifications for time and volume. She was able to incorporate the feedback within the group activity.

During the sample reteach, Michele did not demonstrate clear understanding of WTD directions and she had difficulty incorporating concrete and observable instructions during critical parts of her re-teach. This resulted in her having to do individualized checks to see if students were prepared. She received FA- for the Reteach.

He was able to communicate the lesson fairly succinctly during the lesson. Even when I asked him a question that may have tripped him up, his economy of language during the response stating that even though whether or not someone is hot is an opinion, the temperature in desert areas would factually make it hot. The candidate received an FA in CA because the interpretation of the lesson plan was logical and the examples used were clearly either a fact or an opinion. Candidate received an FA in ES because most of the students were engaged at least once during the lesson. Even though he gave the students an annotation strategy for identifying fact vs. opinion and had the students chorally read the definitions of opinion and fact. He received a FA in CD because the lesson was mostly linear and the materials were used to support mastery however the checks for understanding were  repetitive and superficially addressed fact vs. opinion. 

Group Activity: Vladamir was able to incorporate multiple components of WTD: ""turn to X page and pens on the Egypt paragraph"" ""You will read the paragraph silently and underline words like Egypt, and desert"" ""You will have pens down and eyes on me when you're done"" He was able to give strong feedback to the rest of the group and incorporate my feedback of giving his directions without the use of his notes.

Re-Teach: Based on what I remember Vladamir incorporated WTD but only impartially. He cold called on students to read the paragraphs and told other students so silently follow along. He also had a WTD when the students had to take their worksheets out but I remember that there were only 2 components incorporated.

Overall Vladamir was a strong candidate, he will have to work on incorporating the WTD technique into his own lesson plan but I'm confident he'll be able to work on that over the summer in PST. ",,"Not eligible for English, ESL, and Math (Political Science and History major)",2.983,3.0-3.25

Also, she was able break down the WTD directions in a clear and logical manner.  Her initial proposed directions included concrete, sequential, and observable.

In terms of the TS there was conflicting, FA- and FA+ evidence with an overall FA rating.
In terms of TS she was rated FA due to FA+ in CD and ES and FA- in CA.

In terms of CA she was rated FA-.  Overall she presented a teaching sample not in service to the stated learning objective.  First, her interpretation of the objective was mostly correct but did address the objective in full.  For example, she asked students to identify figurative and literal language in a passage but then in the share she asked what type of figurative language it was (hyperbole, metaphor).  Also, she included minor pieces of extraneous content which distracted from the lesson.  For example, she never defined hyperbole and metaphor but she asked students to identify it.  In addition she used materials, activities, and examples that were slightly confusing to the students for example, asking students to identify figurative in the reading but then verbally asking them what type of figurative language that was.  
 
In terms of CD she was rated FA+.  Overall she facilitated understanding through her delivery.  First she clearly communicated the objective of the lesson to the students for example, she stated the learning objective and provided examples of literal and figurative language.  She used a model to clearly convey information for example, students underlined examples of figurative and literal in their poems after she modeled for them.  Also, she had a check of understanding by asking the students to complete a poem on their own and had them share their responses.  Overall her lesson broke the content into smaller pieces and her presentation was clear and logical, this was a very well planned and executed lesson.

In terms of ES she was rated FA+.  Her lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  She purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example she asked questions about content, asked students to identify literal or figurative language, read aloud a poem, and work independently on a poem.  These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, she gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students could read, listen, respond verbally, write, and share their responses during the lesson.  She also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students complete a poem on their own after she modeled a poem with them.  During the lesson she cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall she intentional engaged all the students throughout her lesson.

In terms of TS he was rated FA+ due to FA+ in ES.  

In terms of ES he was rated FA+.  His lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  He purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example he had students write the definitions on their handout, students answered questions about the content, students read, and students identified fact and opinions and supported their answer with a reason.  These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, he gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students read from the handout, answered questions, copied definitions, and responded to questions verbally.  He also used the handout as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example he had the students complete an end assignment of writing their own examples of fact and opinion.  During the lesson he cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall he intentional engaged all the students throughout his lesson.

In terms of CT there was conflicting evidence, FA- and FA+ but an overall rating of FA.

First, his TSPF was rated FA+.  He included clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  His directions were step by step and included a student activity of students reading and annotating a poem for fact and opinion.  He also included a logical check for student understanding using a handout and having students write their own fact and opinion.  All of his key points are aligned to his objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.

In terms of the GA he was rated FA-.  During the planning for practice part of the GA he was confused about the task and did not follow the directions given.  For example, he did not write his revised direction as a direction, he wrote it as a list not for students but for him.  For example, I would ask students to take out their assignments.  Also, his scenario asked him to get the students discussing problem one but his direction had the students write down key points and not discuss.  Overall his GA was not clear and he did not analyze the information accurately.  

Overall he exceeds the bar with an FA+ in ES but an FA- in the GA.  I am asking for a please review due to the conflicting evidence and if the GA CT would warrant an NFA and a select out.  



","Candidate merits FA- in his GA due to confusion and incoherence, but does not fully cross the line into NFA. He therefore received a CTO rating of FA which means he meets the bar for selection into the program. Note selector's concern with his confusion in regards to the GA.","film degree: 7/2011

Even when she was modeling the coordinates on the board, she was able to do so without turning her back to the class for long periods of time. She maintained eye contact and was able to answer my question succinctly and logically. Bettina received an FA+ in ES because all students participated at least once when they had to practice in pairs how to find the coordinate plane on a worksheet. Not an E because she even though she attempted a choral response, not all students were participating. She also received an FA+ in CD because the model and CFU's were clearly used to check for mastery with the class, she called on volunteers to show that students could plot points and periodically asked students questions like why the point was located in the position according to the X and Y. 

Group Activity: Bettina was strong in the GA. She was able to take and receive feedback as well as incorporating multiple components of the WTD technique. She was very specific, giving chapter and page numbers, gave a clear observable for multiple steps of the directions, and they were sequential. 

Reteach: Bettina was able to incorporate at least 2 components of WTD in her Re-Teach. She gave clear observables while she was modeling to show that the students were following along with what she was doing on the board. She also gave WTD for students to put material on their desk before she began her model. She used WTD to begin an academic task, used it multiple times, which is why she received a FA+.

Overall Bettina is a stong candidate, her TSO and CTO were strong. Her TP showed a clear command of confidence and her delivery was strong in the material that could otherwise get very confusing. ",,"prefers english and sped english but no degree

TSPF CT: FA+ Jennyfer completed the plan logically and appropriately, with activities that flowed logically and were aligned to the objective. There was significant detail in her plan, which was logical and relevant.  She described student and teacher actions and the CFU was logical and connected to independent student work.  TP: FA+ Jennyffer was confident throughout the lesson and attempted to be engaging through a variation of her tone, her body movement, and through smiling. She projected her voice in a manner that was appropriate and maintained an appropriate volume throughout. She maintained eye contact and faced the class consistently, speaking succinctly with some instances of strength in EOL.  CA: FA Her interpretation of the objective was correct and she address the objective completely, prioritizing the content.  She used examples and materials that were logical and conveyed accurate information throughout, except for when she told students facts can also be false and giving an erroneous example of that.  CD: FA The objective was clear to students because she stated it and she presented information in a linear manner, utilizing a model to share information. She used materials and questioning to support mastery and attempted a CFU, although it was unclear whether all students understood or just the students who participated in the end.  ES: FA+ All students participated through multiple means, students being cold-called, writing, working on their worksheets, and chorally reading, all of which helped advance the lesson forward and getting students to complete an academic task.  MIT: FA The pacing was steady overall, but the ending was rushed to be completed.  She referred to her lesson notes in a couple of instances, but it didn't affect her overall lesson flow.  GA CT: FA Jennyfer participated appropriately and gave feedback to her partners that helped them improve their WTD, although her initial WTD only contained 2 of the components of WTD.  Her revised instructions incorporated responsively feedback from me.   TSRT CT: FA+ While Jennyffer included three instances of WTD, not all instructions helped drive the lesson forward, however, they made sense within the context of the lesson.

When I asked a question she did get flustered. Asked: If I believe that roses are the best smelling flower why isn't a fact? (she had not defined the terms). She did pause when answering. Voice volume and tone were all appropriate. ES is FA+ because all students were engaged at least once when she instructed the class to complete the first 3 questions on her worksheet. Her CD is FA- because the sequencing of her lesson was illogical. She started asking the class what were facts and opinions before she even told them what those words meant.

Group Activity: Jokasta was able to participate in the GA and was able to demonstrate some strengths that didn't necessarily come to play during her TSO. She was able to deliver clear WTD, with multiple components. She was able to provide feedback that was helpful, not as much as the other stronger personalities however she showed that she could provide and receive feedback. 

Re-Teach: Jokasta, though a bit stilted in her delivery because it was one WTD after another, after another, clearly knew that she had to use WTD for multiple steps in her lesson plan. She used it when they had to take out their worksheet, to write their name and the date (even though this direction probably could have been combined), and when the students were going into an independent and academic activity. She incorporated time (20 seconds) making it concrete and clear observables.

Students are then provided 30 seconds to complete the check for understanding handout. The candidate begins to review the responses. The candidate does not finish the review in the allotted time. During the GA, the candidate initially does not provide any useful feedback and does not throughout the session, however, she effectively and accurately implement the elements of WTD. During the RT, the candidate begins the lesson by asking student to take out a worksheet. When the question is answered she instructs them to raise their hand when they are done. She implements WTD throughout the activity by requiring students to provide an observable. She is uneven on concrete and sequential, but still demonstrate an understanding of the elements. I believe that with additional support the candidate will begin successful in the program. ",,Missing one math and one art/music course for D75,3.44,3.0-3.25

She was rated TP - E, TS - FA+, CT - FA+, CS - FA, and EPT - FA. She was respectful of others for the duration of the vent and demonstrated a willingness to learn. She demonstrated fluent use of English and communicated effectively. 
Overall the TSPF was FA. All key points were somewhat aligned to the chosen objective and the candidate logically and appropriately completed the planning form. The candidate included an activity to meet the objective and described giving the definition of the main idea, but does not plan out key teaching points. The candidate included what she should say at different points and what the students should be doing. The candidate detailed exemplar student answers when answering questions about the key details or the main idea. The planned activities were logical. The check for understanding somewhat addresses the lesson objective by asking students to identify the main idea and supporting details of the text. 
TP - E. The candidate was confident throughout the lesson and uses a variety of questions, points, drawings, and tone of voice to engage students. The candidate projected her voice at an appropriate volume so that she could be heard throughout the classroom, albeit a little loud. The candidate maintained eye contact with students throughout the lesson and maintains economy of language. She spoke without pauses or filters and moved around the front of the room. She was warm to students and peers throughout. 
CA - FA+. The candidates interpretation of the provided objective is correct and the lesson addresses the full objective. The candidate prioritized the important information of main idea and key details and explained the difference between them. She checked for understanding by asking questions. Her answer to the selectors question (How can I tell what is the important information?) helped with mastery of the objective. The candidate conveyed accurate content and used examples, a reading activity, and materials to support mastery of the objective though she did not model. 
CD - FA+. The lesson objective was mostly clear to students as the teacher stated it at the beginning of the lesson. The candidate presented information linearly by defining first before doing an activity. The candidate used an anchor chart and activity to support mastery. The teacher used a volunteer CFU to find key details and the main idea of the text. 
ES - FA+. The candidate purposefully engages all participants in a way that drives instruction forward. She used cold call and had students help read the lesson aloud. The candidate gives students a way to participate verbally by reading and answering questions. The candidate addressed the questions when they arose. 
MIT - E. The candidate used a steady lesson pace and finished the lesson with 3 seconds left. The candidate stayed on target with an efficient use of time. The time was mostly spent on the most important activities that advanced student learning. ",,"prefers ENL but only has 6 spanish and 5 chinese credits

He received a E in ES because he had all students participate at least twice: a choral reading of the definitions of fact and opinion, as well as all students answer questions on a worksheet. He received a FA in CD because although  he was engaging in this TP and ES, his CD was still fairly linear. Definitions, model, examples, student practice. 

Group Activity: Kevin was strong in the GA. He was able to deliver directions that had at least 3 components of WTD, making his directions sequential observable and specific. He was also able to provide feedback each round of the candidate that was both positive and negative. Even when he stated that he thought the directions sounded good, he still attempted, and was able to build off of other people's feedback. 

Re-Teach: Re-Teach was not as strong as the Group Activity, which may show that he may have some trouble incorporating techniques into the LP. Directions were very vague, like ""carefully listen"" or ""take a few minutes"". Even though he did not get to finish his last directions, it was clear that he was transitioning to an academic activity. He also tried to incorporate my feedback because I told him to use the directions to transition to a group or independent activity. 

Overall Kevin seems like an eager candidate based on his  TSO and CTO. I do question how he'll deal with more rigorous content, instead of giving a fairly simple lesson on the American Flag. However, rigor of the content is not being assessed so overall he is a strong candidate. ",,"missing 2 science credits but still eligible for D75

However, once he began the lesson, he maintained appropriate eye contact, voice volume and tone. He had an ease to his delivery, and even though he was a clear accent, it did not impede understanding of his delivery. Candidate received a FA in ES because most students participated at least once, rather than all. He did not have students write anything, besides the definition that was on the board, that's not really testing their understanding. He also recieved an FA in CD because the delivery of the lesson was fairly linear: definitions, examples, text, questions.

Group Activity: Clement really shined in the Group Activity. He is very methodical and this came out. Even when other candidates thought the directions given were good, Clemente was able to think of hypothetical or specific scenarios where if they did something different, it could improve the direction given. He gave strong directions and was able to incorporate my feedback but saying his directions in less words. Overall he will have to work on his economy of language, in general though. 

Re-Teach: Clement demonstrated a clear understanding of the purpose of What to Do and incorporated to multiple parts of the lesson. He used it to the transition the class into a class reading of the ""I Have a Dream"" speech as well as when the students were wrapping up their underlining He used it to complete and academic task, however since he only really had 2 components, specific and observable, this is what kept him from getting an E.

Clement is a strong candidate for PST. Even though he demonstrated an tendency to be a little wordy, asking questions (not inappropriate, applicable to a classroom) and he had a lot to say during the check in during hte planning time for the re-teach. however he is very methodical which  should be able to help him over the summer.

Jessica's TS provided mixed evidence. There was strength in TP (FA+) as Jessica varied her tone and body language to build engagement. She generally faced the class and spoke loudly, though economy of language was not evident. Her interpretation of the objective was accurate and activities aligned to respiration. There were small, but noticeable content errors around naming parts of the system (CA - FA). Her objective was clearly stated and she used models (grape stem, diagram) to clearly present content. She attempted to CFU by having students complete a bubble map (CD - FA). Some misallocation of time meant this activity was rushed and confusing (MIT - FA). Aside from the attempt at the bubble map, some students were engaged through questioning (ES - FA).

Jessica showed strength in CTO (FA+). Jessica's TSPF is completed logically. Key points present an overview of what will be taught. Student actions are explained at most points. Student practice is hinted out, but not detailed, and there is at least a partial CFU through questioning. During the group activity, Jessica's initial directions were concrete, specific, and observable. She had excellent feedback centered on elements of WTD for each partner.

She is engaging in her interactions and presentation to the students, staying in character, able to projects her voice loudly enough that all students can hear.  Throughout the lesson she attempts to be engaging through a variation of tone and questioning techniques.  She purposefully engages all participants at least once during the lesson in a way that drives instruction forward and pushes academic thinking.

However, his economy of language was a bit of a hindrance. He had moments of being non-succint and when answer the question asked he showed some hesitation. Overall however, he maintained eye contact and had a formal tone, therefore he is FA. During the Teaching Sample, he showed evidence for FA in ES because there was no overall activity, besides reading along, where the students participated in the lesson. Most candidates were called upon for strictly volunteered responses. For CD, the candidate receives FA because the objective was clearly stated, he broke down the definition of personification (even though it was slightly disjointed) and he gave an example as a Do Now where the students had to decipher which sentence used personification and why. The material provided supported his objective of figurative language in poetry however he did not clearly model which held him back from receiving an FA.

Group Activity: During the Group Activity, the candidate was able to incorporate multiple components of What to Do, an example of directions he delivered were ""Revised Direction: When I count to 3 every students needs to pick up their pencil and copy the definitions on the board, when you're down pens down and eyes on me to await further instruction."" He was also able to incorporate my feedback of making his directions more specific ""where are students writing their notes?"" He only receives an FA and not FA+ because he did not provide any useful feedback during the feedback rounds of the other candidates. 

Re-Teach: During the candidates Re-Teach, he was able to incorporate most if not all the components of What To Do. An example of a direction he provided is""Clear your desk, only things you should have is the poem, a pen or a pencil. Once you have done that, please pick up their pen/pencil and point to ""It's Spring"". You will silently read the poem, while you read, circle the lines that personify personification. You have 1 minute, put your pen down and wait for further instructions."" He received an FA+ because he gave directions that were able to lead the students to an academic task however he will have issues with his economy of language. He has a tendency to hesitate or lose track of his wording, it's by no means severe but it is present. ","Mr. Devon Elliott is a previous applicant to the Fellows Program.

Ralph's TS presented mixed evidence. His TP was strong (FA+), in that he effectively varied his tone to build engagement. He spoke loudly and clearly, demonstrating economy of language at most points. His interpretation of the objective was correct and he provided accurate content. The activities are relevant, but a lack of prioritization means that student practice is omitted (CA - FA). Ralph stated his objective and modeled fact v. opinion with a t-chart. There was a partial attempt to CFU through questioning (CD - FA). Most students were engaged through questioning, and a few had an opportunity to read (ES - FA). Pace was uneven and lesson time misallocated: an overlong opening meant that student practice did not occur (MIT - FA-). 

Ralph demonstrated strength in CTO (FA+). Ralph's TSPF presented mixed, but primarily positive, evidence for CT. He addresses the objective of fact vs. opinion in full and most activities are aligned. Key points and closing introduce some irrelevant musings about the importance of viewing learning as a life-long process. During the group activity, Ralph's initial directions were concrete, specific, and observable. He gave feedback that would improve at least two of his partners direction. Ralph was asked to incorporate economy of language, and he was largely successful. In the reteach, Ralph's addressed my feedback and gave directions that incorporated at least two elements of WTD. He used WTD directions wherever appropriate.

She was able to get through a fairly dense lesson, about an objective that is done very often, quickly and with purpose, without feeing rushed. She received an FA + in ES because all students participated at least once when completing an example from the worksheet she provied. She also received an FA+ in CD because of her incorporation of guiding questions to help students determine what the author's purpose is. By asking students to  Does this text convince me? Does this text teach me? Does this text amuse me? She is providing to students a way to assess the author's purpose independently, and not simply relying on the use of the words inform, entertain, or persuade. Even though entertain does not inherently mean to be amused, given the the lesson is only 5 minutes long, she used her time effectively. 

Group Activity: Rachael was very strong during the Group Activity, she most definitely took a leadership role in the group being one of the few candidates to provide actionable glows and grows. Her directions incorporated multiple components of What to Do directions. An example being: ""Revised Direction: Once you have finished reading the article, silently underline key ideas, when you're done please put your pencils down."" The candidate was able to provide multiple components, provide actionable feedback, and incorporate the feedback I provided to her so she receives an FA+.

Re-Teach: The candidate receives an E in Re-teach because of her clear incorporation of What to Do to complete an academic task in her re-teach. An example of directions she provided is: ""Please locate example 2 on your worksheet, place your pen on number 2 so I know you know where you are. When I say begin, you will silently read the example, once that is done, circle yes or no for questions 1,2,3, then answer the final question of the author's purpose. I know you are done when you have pencils down and eyes on me."" Overall this candidate was strong throughout the interview and she will be a strong candidate for the summer.

In the TSRT, she had one solid WTD with 3 elements, but missed other opportunities to include a WTD for a FA+ in TSRT CT. In the TSPF, she had some extraneous details off objective (using ""students will learn facts about bears"" as a key point) and having a general lack of detail, for a  FA in TSPFCT and a FA+ in CTO.  During the TS, she was somewhat confident, but not engaging. She faced the class and had some economy of language. She was FA in TP. In the TS, she was again hurt by her extraneous details and focus on bears rather than finding the main idea. She did use a model of a flower with petals to show the main idea and supporting details (petals!), and was FA+ in CD. She engaged all students once by asking questions to some, and asking all to read a second story and find the main idea. She is FA+ in ES. So, with a FA+ in both CTO and TS, she is selected in and accepted.

She has planned checks for understanding and clear teacher actions and student actions. She has independent work planned for the students and multiple ways to assess their understanding of the content. During her Teaching Sample, Jacquelyn maintained eye contact, confident body language, a formal and appropriately volumed tone, and spoke succinctly and clearly.  She asked students to activate their prior knowledge from the day before to connect to the lesson and communicated the objective to students. She asked students to read sentences on a handout and asked them to push their thinking by explaining why and how they got their answers.  When I and another student asked clarifying questions, she offered explanations that helped deepen understanding of the topic (one student asked about a sentence, ""the more money you have the more successful you are."" She pushed their thinking and helped them understand by asking how she defined success, and whether her definition of success would be the same as another person's).  She repeatedly said that the information that you find in textbooks are facts, which is not definitively accurate because history textbooks throughout history have provided misinformation that can be subjective depending on who is writing the textbook and their version of history, but for the purposes of an introductory lesson on Fact and  Opinion, she did an excellent job of making references to texts and resources that the students can recognize in their daily lives.  She gave them opportunities to engage with an independent work task and then come back together to discuss their answers and explain their thinking.
During her Group Activity, Jacqueline provided feedback that was instructive in moving her groupmates forward in their WTD directions. She also hit on all components of WTD, so my feedback to her was to limit her words and practice economy of language, which she was able to do.

CA The way Sharivia interpreted the chosen objective was correct and the lesson addressed the objective fully.  She used a visual poster to help students clearly understand the objective and provided a worksheet for students to match parts with their functions. Sharivia spent the majority of the lesson covering the most important material, as she went through each of the parts using the visual diagram. The lesson activity was clearly aligned to the chosen objective and helped moved students towards understanding the objective.

Sharivia checked for understanding in part as she went over two of the remaining examples on the worksheet that students were required to complete on their own. Sharivia struggled slightly when it came to engaging students.  Out of seven candidates, only four students volunteered answers and spoke.  There weren't many opportunities for student engagement as they completed a worksheet that required them to draw a line from the part of the respiratory system to the corresponding function.  Sharivia's initial planned directions incorporated 3 of the components of WTD directions.  When she received selector feedback, she excelled, incorporating all components.

Teacher and student actions are outlined clearly and in detail.  Based on the TSPF there is a check for understanding where students will have to complete two, two-step equations to solve for the value of an unknown variable. Stephanie was confident throughout the lesson, but her tone was not necessarily engaging.  Despite this, she did use multiple methods to engage students.  She asked several questions and took volunteers.  As she worked through examples of problems on the board she also cold called different students.  Students were required to follow along with what she wrote on the board as well as completing a basic set of guided notes, where students had to fill in several blanks.  The way Stephanie interpreted the chosen objective was correct and the lesson addressed the objective fully.  She spent time on the most important content by briefly reviewing inverse operations, but making sure that students understood how to solve the two-step equations.  The example was appropriate and aligned as it was a basic two-step equation that she and the students worked through together.  Although the lesson objective was not explicitly stated, it was clear to the students through the examples used.  The check for understanding was not clear as the candidate ran out of time before she could check for understanding. Stephanie failed to make adjustments to her lesson based on time and therefore the lesson had a rushed finish.  Stephanie remained on task and focused throughout the group activity.  She attempted to use the feedback cheat sheet with uneven results.  She struggled giving one of her group members a grow, but eventually gave one to one of her group members.  She didn’t use the language of the feedback cheat sheet completely, but did use it as a point of reference.  Her initial planned directions incorporated three WTD components accurately.  Her revised directions did not necessarily incorporate group member feedback accurately, as she added in ""when I ring the bell"" as a signal to start as opposed to an observable. When urged to use a different observable, she was unable to do so. During the reteach, Stephanie attempted to use WTD.  She did so successfully. She used WTD multiple times in ways that moved students towards the completion of an academic task.  This demonstrates her strength in critical thinking.

Vanessa earned an FA+ in the teaching sample overall.  She received an Fa+ in the teaching sample planning form.  In TP she earned an FA as she did not have economy of language as she lectured for a large portion of the lesson before assigning an activity and assessing the students.  In ES she earned an FA+ as there were multiple opportunities for the students to be engaged such as cold call and an activity sheet. In MIT she earned an E as she was able to adjust her lesson at the one minute mark to include the assessment.

She had students provide examples.  (CD- FA-).  The activies where aligned to the objective, but there were some confusing elements, but this was the only FA- indicator in CA, so holistically CA was FA.  Her ES was also FA+.

Her TP was strong: though she sometimes rapidly repeated herself, she was overall very audible, engaging, and warm throughout the TS. Her TS on literal vs. figurative language was strong in CA and CD, and weaker in ES and MIT. Her entire lesson was aligned with her obj (she defined literal and fig lang, provided 3 examples of each, and had some S identify sentences as literal or fig), and had no inaccuracies, so she was E in CA. She used multiple examples, had a CFU, and asked S to explain their answers, so she was FA+ in CD. In ES, she was FA because though many S answered Qs aloud, not all did so in an academic way, and there was no other way to participate in the lesson. In MIT, she was also FA because she rushed to finish and did not completely finish her worksheet. Overall, her TS was FA+

During the GA, her initial directions were a little misaligned with the scenario, though she did have specific and obs steps. She was open to fdbk, gave good fdbk to others, and improved her directions with my fdbk. Thus, she was FA+ in GA CT. During the TSR, she attempted WTD 2x and incorporated 3 elements of WTD (seq, specific, obs). Thus, she was FA+ in TSR CT and FA+ in CTO.

She also showed a lot of hesitation when incorporating my feedback of giving her directions with limited used of her notes. She stopped and started again at least 3 times. She did get through it however but she may have trouble being agile and recovering from moments that are not scripted come PST.

Re-Teach: Candidate recieved a FA- in Reteach. She only used about 35-40 seconds of her re-teach, leaving approximately 1:15 left in the re-teach. Here is a sample of the directions she provided: ""Stop what you're doing, and I'll pass out a worksheet. On this worksheet you will be writing notes. Use your pencils Also we will be doing a problem together on this poster, look up when you're ready to begin."" The only component she really utilizes is ""look up when you're done"" as an observable. Her attempt to incorporate WTD demonstrates hat she does not fully understand the techniques outside of the scenarios practiced during the Group Activity. She may have trouble incorporating techniques from TLAC into her lesson plans during PST. ",BE but more than 12 lib arts credits ,"Calc:

It was detailed and logical in both the teacher and the students actions.  The CFU was aligned but it did not require the students to apply the skill.  During the teaching sample her TP was FA. She was confident throughout the lesson but she was speaking quickly so it was a little difficult to follow her at all times.  Also, she did not attempt to engage the students through the variation of tone or body language. Her TSO was E.  She stated the objective at the beginning of the lesson, to learn about the concept of area and apply that to the area of triangles.  All the lesson activities were logically aligned and built off each other to teach the concept of area of triangles.  The materials and questions she used supported mastery of the content.   (CA E).  Her CFU did ask to the students to apply the skill and she had multiple checks throughout the lesson which layered on the content. (CD E).  All the students completed a worksheet and most were engaged through questions. (ES FA+). Her MIT was also FA+. She prioritized the content, but the lesson did feel a little rushed because she was trying to get through a lot of content.  During the GA she showed that she had an understanding of the skill of of WTD.  Her first set of directions were sequential but they needed some work on the other elements.  She received some quality feedback that improved her directions.  Her final directions were missing concrete elements and she struggled to implement that feedback.  She was mostly quiet  during the feedback portion of the GA, but she did give one piece of great feedback related to WTD (GA FA) During the reteach she added WTD directions that improved the learning in the lesson and helped the students complete an academic task.

Cassandra spoke succinctly and clearly and when asked a question from the selector, she answered using economy of language in a way that the question was answered quickly and effectively.  The chosen objective was interpreted correctly and the lesson and lesson activities fully addressed the objective.  She spent the majority of the lesson explaining what longitude and latitude is and how to find a place on those lines utilizing a model. She did activity one with students to clearly model how to find longitude and latitude.  At the beginning of the lesson, Cassandra clearly stated the objective so that it would be known to students.  She checked for understanding towards the end of the lesson by asking a series of three questions.  The questions started off basic, she just asked students what longitude and latitude is.  Then the questions increased in difficulty as she asked what the difference between the two is. She even pushed one student volunteer to explain how they were able to locate a coordinate. Cassandra engaged 3 out of 6 students regularly by asking questions and taking volunteers.  Students were also required to utilize the worksheet by finding and tracing latitude and longitude lines.  Cassandra was able to summarize and ask check for understanding questions within her teaching time and finished with 6 seconds remaining.  The lesson has a steady pace and did not feel rushed. During the group activity, Cassandra remained focused and on task. She was able to give her group members glows and grows from the feedback cheat sheet.  At one point, she even gave a group member a suggestion and example of how to make their directions even more observable.

Group Activity: Candidate received an FA+ in GA because she was able to incorporate multiple components of WTD, gave actionable feedback to fellow candidates was able to redeliver her lessons based on my feedback of giving a new observable. Sample directions she provided: Revised Direction: Stop what you're doing, pick up pencil and individually silently, 3 minutes to reread your article and underline words that relate to the main idea of the article only. Turn your paper over and sit quietly."" She gave good feedback to a candidate about how ""in door voices"" is very subjective and to be more concrete.

Re-Teach: The candidate has received an FA+ in this section. Even though towards the end of the lesson once she had given the directions to the students to complete the next example, she just stood there and waited for the 2 minutes to be over. However she incorporated at least 2 components of WTD in her direction specially with observable and concrete, here is a sample: ""Take out the worksheet that has your name and example 1 at the top and put it in front of you. You have 3 minutes to silently and independently to complete the next problem. When you are done put your pencils down and sit quietly with a smile on your face.""

When I asked her if a text is still entertaining if I'm not enjoying it, she said that yes, you have to focus on the purpose of the writing: is it trying to tell you something, to convince you of something, or to give you enjoyment?  She asked the groups to share out their generated sentences and addressed why those sentences align with the different type(s) of writing.

The reason why she is not FA+ is because she only provided positive feedback, and gave no actionable feedback. 

Re-Teach: Re-Teach received an FA because although she hit 2 components of the WTD directions, clear examples of concrete, it's not specific in terms of how to complete the ven diagram and she did not utlize her name to incorporate WTD directions in multiple sections of her 2 minute delivery. An example of her WTD is ""I have left a venn diagarm on your desk, please take that out.

The plan was logically filled out but there was a lack of detail in the lesson activities and the CFU.  The CFU is listed as “exit slip” but there is no sense of what that exit slip will entail. During the teaching sample her TP was FA.  She was speaking quickly throughout the lesson but the student understood all that was being said. She also needed to go to her bag during the lesson to get more materials, which made her not facing the class during all parts of the sample. Her TSO was FA.  She stated the objective at the beginning of the lesson, to distinguish between figurative and literal language.  As she stated and defined each term she stated that “I know everyone knows what these are.”  She then introduced four types of figurative language, but did not define them.  When students were sharing about figurative or literal sentences, all of her questions were about why type of figurative language they were, which represented misalignment (CA FA-).  She did define the terms and talke about theme linearly and she attempted to CFU (CD- FA).  All students were engaged in group work with a text and most answered questions (ES FA+).  Her lesson pace was steady at the beginning but then fell off in the last minute.  At 4:10 she handed out exit slips and said she would collect them at the end.  At 4:30 she started cleaning up her posters, then while we clapped she ended her lesson with, “that's figurative and literal language.” During the GA she showed that she had an understanding of the skill of of WTD.  Her first set of directions were sequential but they needed some work on the other elements.  She received some quality feedback that improved her directions.  Her final directions were missing observable elements and she implemented that feedback..  During the feedback portion of the GA she mostly agreed with feedback that the other partners were giving, she struggled to offer her own piece of feedback that was not related to another group member's statement (FA).

Latoya will have to ensure that she leaves enough time for all activities. During the Group Activity, Latoya was able to use all four components of WTD. She offered suggestions to those in the group in order to help group-mates write better WTD directions. Latoya was able to apply interviewer feedback. During the TS Re-Teach, Latoya was able to incorporate WTD in order to have students complete a task. Her directions made sense within the context of the lesson and students successfully completed the task. Latoya could have included WTD in other parts of the lesson. In reviewing Latoya's file overall, there were no flags from the pre-screener or phone interviewer.

In terms of CT he was rated E due to an E rating in the reteach and FA+ in TSPF and the GA.  

First, his TSPF was rated FA+.  He included clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  His directions were step by step and included a student activity of students using different stanzas to identify literal and figurative language.  He also included a logical check for student understanding using his handout and questions at the end of the lesson.  All of his key points are aligned to his objective and the plan includes only essential information for the lesson.  Finally the teacher and student actions were explained in detail and were relevant to the learning objective.

Second, in terms of CT during the GA he was rated FA+.  He was able to appropriately participate in the planning for practice activity and followed all directions.  Also, he was able break down the WTD directions in a clear and logical manner.  His initial proposed directions included concrete, sequential, and observable.  His feedback to his partner, was specific, for example he stated to feedback to partner A, ""follow could be confusing because they might look at the book, you could say follow on the page,"" and to feedback partner B, ""break it into 2 parts, add an observable.""  This suggestion helped improve his partner’s directions.  His revised directions accurately incorporated my feedback.  For example, I told him to make break into table groups more concrete.  In response he stated, ""join your 2 partners by your table.""  Overall he demonstrated the ability to learn a new skill and apply that learning in a clear and logical manner.

Finally, in terms of the reteach he was rated E.  He accurately incorporated the WTD directions and my feedback into his reteach.  For example, my written grow was to tell the students what to do while they are reading the poem and he stated, ""as she reads, follow along on the page and read quietly.""  This demonstrated a clear understanding of the feedback and the ability to interpret the information clearly.  Finally his WTD directions made sense in the context of his lesson and lead students toward successfully completing an academic task.  For example, he stated, ""use your pen and underline the first two lines in stanza one.  When you are finished eyes on me.  Read stanza 2, pens up, find one word in stanza two that could be figured.  You have one minute to read quietly.  When you are done pencils down and look at me,"" as examples of successful incorporating concrete, sequential, and observable directions.  Overall he was able to incorporate WTD directions in most parts of the lesson where appropriate.  Hold up your pens and look at me.  

In terms of TS he is rated FA+ due to FA+ in CD and MIT.  

In terms of CD he was rated FA+.  Overall he facilitated understanding through his delivery.  First he clearly communicated the objective of the lesson to the students for example he stated the objective of literal and figurative language and then he defined each terms and used examples.  He used a model to clearly convey information for example he had the students read the first stanza of a poem and find literal interpretations and then he had them look at the second stanza for figurative language.   Also, he had a check of understanding by asking the students to complete a final poem and share their responses.  Overall his lesson broke the content into smaller pieces and his presentation was clear and logical, this was a very well planned and executed lesson from his handout to his flow.

In terms of MIT he was rated FA+ his lesson had a steady pace and he finished his lesson in time, getting through all of his activities.  Also, much of the time was spent on the most important activities to advance student understanding which was practicing the skill of identifying literal and figurative language.

Overall Michael exceeds the bar for acceptance and is selected in.

Elizabeth's interpretation of the lesson objective is correct and the lesson addresses the full obj. She uses examples and materials (handout) which are logical and relevant to the lesson. She conveys accurate content. Her response to selector question is correct but wordy and does not succinctly re-explain why the example is figurative language. Content Delivery is FA+. The lesson aim is written on the board for students to see. She uses materials which are in service to the objective. Her CFU aligns with the objective. During the CFU she asks multiple students to support their answers with evidence. Engages students is FA+ because she engages students through multiple modes. Throughout the lesson, Elizabeth purposefully engages all participants at least once (they all write down examples of fig and lit language) and give most others more than one way get involved in the lesson (cold call, volunteer, verbal response). MIT is FA. The candidate refers to lesson notes throughout the lesson, but it does not interfere with her delivery of the lesson. She does not get to full complete her planned CFU. CT during the GA is FA+ She stays on topic during the activity. Her original WTD directions incorporate 3 components of WTD. In addition she offers her peers suggestions which would improve their WTD directions--""Make the directions Specific. Tell the other groups they have to be silent when the other groups are presenting."" She accurately incorporates interviewer feedback. CT during re-teach is E.

It was detailed and logically aligned. The CFU asks the students to apply the skill but the lesson activities do not facilitate mastery of the objective.  During the teaching sample her TP was FA.

She stated the objective at the start of the lesson, to distinguish fact and opinion in a nonfiction text.  She then just stated the definitions and started in the text. She did not model how to find facts and opinions, she just relied on the prior knowledge of the students.  The work in the text would serve as a check because she did have the students underline the facts and circle the opinions (CD FA).  All the activities were aligned to the objective, but there was an inaccuracy when address the coach question (CA FA). All students read in a text and underlined in the text and most students responded to questions (ES FA+).  Her lesson was steady in pace and she did try and rush at the end to finish the text (MIT FA).  During the GA she showed and understanding of WTD.  She offered some feedback to both of her partners that was related to WTD.  Her final set of directions needed some work on the concrete elements and she incorporated that feedback. In the reteach, she added WTD directions at the beginning of the reteach, to gather all the students attention and had them following along in the text to circle or underline as they went.

In terms of CT she was rated FA+ due to an FA+ in the TSPF, GA and the reteach.

First, her TSPF was rated FA+.  She included clear instructions for the teacher and the students.  Her directions were step by step and included a student activity of students working on groups and determining the author's purpose,  She also included a logical check for student understanding using questions at the end of the lesson and the note card activity.

These suggestion helped improve her partner’s directions.  Her revised directions accurately incorporated my feedback.  For example, I told her to make finding the heading more concrete.  In response she stated, ""located by the bold picture.""  Overall she demonstrated the ability to learn a new skill and apply that learning in a clear and logical manner.

Finally, in terms of the reteach she was rated FA+.  She accurately incorporated the WTD directions and my feedback into her reteach.  For example, my written grow was to tell the students what to do in their groups and she stated, ""Now I want you take 10 seconds to softly decide with your group the purpose of the text.""  This demonstrated a clear understanding of the feedback and the ability to interpret the information clearly.  Finally her WTD directions made sense in the context of her lesson and lead students toward successfully completing an academic task.  For example, she stated, ""in your right hand hold up the pink card if the purpose is to persuade, the white card if the purpose is to entertain.  Eyes on me as I read text 3,"" as examples of successful incorporating concrete, sequential, and observable directions.  Overall she was able to incorporate WTD directions in most parts of the lesson where appropriate.  

In terms of TP she was rated FA+.  She exhibited an ease, poise, and self-assurance with her interactions with the class.  She also demonstrated a confidence in her interactions.  She projected her voice and used both formal and informal tone depending on the part of the class.  In addition her tone was at an appropriate volume.  She maintained eye contact with the students and was always facing the class.  Finally, she spoke succinctly and clearly throughout the lesson and displayed instances of economy of language.

In terms of TS she was rated FA+ due to FA+ in ES and CD.

In terms of CD she was rated FA+.  Overall she facilitated understanding through her delivery.  First she clearly communicated the objective of the lesson to the students for example she read her objective off of her chart paper.  She used a model to clearly convey information for example she gave the students note cards with the 3 types of author's purpose to hold up during the text reading.  Also, she had a check of understanding by asking the students to hold up cards and share their responses.  Overall her lesson broke the content into smaller pieces and her presentation was clear and logical, this was a very well planned and executed lesson.  

In terms of ES she was rated FA+.  Her lesson was planned to promote student engagement at each stage of the lesson.  She purposefully engaged all students at least once during the lesson.  For example she provided students with cards to hold up as she read, she asked questions about the content, and she asked students to agree or disagree with each other.    These forms of engagement pushed the academic thinking forward and helped drive instruction.  Also, she gave the students more than one way to participate in the lesson.  For example students answered questions, worked in groups, held up note cards, and read texts.   She also used the note cards as a way to engage the class and as a check for student understanding, for example she had the students hold up the cards to test their knowledge of author's purpose.   During the lesson she cold called students and called on specific students who were not engaged in the lesson.  Overall she intentional engaged all the students throughout her lesson.

In the TSPF arena scored an FA+. She completed the form logically and aligned all key points to the objective. Teacher action and student action are explained in detail,. The lesson activity of reading an article and identifying the main idea and supporting details addresses the objective. 

In TP Serena scored an FA+. She was confident through out the lesson and she projected her voice for the entire time. She maintained eye contact with the class and she spoke with economy of language. Her mannerisms were engaging. In CA she scored an FA+. She fully interpreted the objective of identifying main idea and supporting details. She used materials about bats and trash that were in service to the objective. She conveyed accurate content the entire time. In CD she scored an FA+. The lesson objective was clear to participants and she modeled the lesson. She also was able to ask students to explain their answers why lines of the text were supporting details. In ES she scored an FA. All students write down the definition and some students answered reasons why the lines of the text were supporting details or main idea. She was slow to answer my question and I had my hand raised for a while. In MIT she scored an FA+.The lesson pace was steady and most of the time was spent modeling or practicing. Overall she scored an FA+ in the TS. 

In the direction she presented to the group it included all elements but was somewhat out of sequence ""read silently along with me, place finger on the text, two seconds to turn to 30"". She suggested a better way to make another persons more sequential and a more logical order. She suggested a behavior for the second partner to make it more specific. In the direction she presented to me my feedback was to tell students how they should be opening up their text book. She was able to implement my feedback.  She scored an FA+ in the TSRT. 

 In the TSRT Serena scored an FA+. She gave participants two WTD directions. One to read paragraph one and another to write down the details into the organizer.

For CA, her interpretation of the objective is correct and she addresses most of the important content related to the objective. She used materials that were logical to and relevant to the lesson. Her response to a student is incorrect, but she catches herself and corrects. For CD, the lesson objective was mostly clear to the students but not stated, and the information was presented linearly. She attempted to check for understanding, but it did not require the students to support with evidence. For ES, Erin engaged all of the students in the lesson at least once in ways that drove instruction forward and she addresses the questions that arose from the class. For MIT, the lesson pace was a bit rushed and there was a wasted time t the end when she asked the students for questions to fill time and then still finished the lesson 30 seconds early. For the group activity, Erin gave directions that initially had 2 components of WTD, but listened to the feedback of the others and was able to make her directions more concrete. She also gave feedback to other candidates that helped to improve their directions. For the re-teach, Erin accurately attempts to incorporate WTD directions in a way that shows an understanding of the technique. The directions make sense in the context of the lesson and leads the students toward completing an academic task. Although the teaching sample was not initially strong, Erin was able to excel in the group activity and the re-teach which shows improvement.

During the group activity, John's initial proposed direction was sequential, observable, and concrete.

During practice, his directions incorporated all elements of WTD. He incorporated selector feedback with accuracy. FA+

During his TSRT, John's WTD direction was observable and concrete, although not necessarily moving students toward an academic task. He used the obserable component after each direction, making his directions excessively wordy. FA

During Mercedes' teaching sample, she was mostly confident, though not necessarily engaging. Her voice tone and volume were both appropriate, and she maintained consistent eye contact. Although she occasionally lost economy of language due to filler, this did not detract from the content or the lesson.
CA: FA+
The objective was interpreted correctly and addressed in full. Materials were fully relevant, and content was mostly accurate. Minor inaccuracies did not detract from the lesson. Content was prioritized.
CD: FA
The lesson objective was mostly clear. Information was presented linearly (mostly lecture style). There is an attempt to check for understanding with the handout, although she did not have students share out.
ES: FA-
2-3 students volunteered responses to questions at the beginning of the lesson. Mercedes then lectured for the next few minutes and then had students complete the worksheet silently for the last minute. Selector needed to call out her name for her to recognize a raised hand.
MIT: FA
Timing was somewhat generally steady, though slightly imperfect (e.g., minute spent on worksheet at the end). She finished on time.
TSO: FA

During the group activity, Mercedes participated actively. Her initial proposed direction was specific, concrete, sequential, and observable and moved students toward the goal of copying definitions off the board. Her feedback was logical, although once she was only able to give positive feedback. She incorporated selector feedback somewhat imperfectly (out of sequence) but with accuracy. FA

During her TSRT, Mercedes' WTD directions accurately incorporated elements of sequential, observable, specific, and concrete, moving students toward the academic task of completing the worksheet. She used the technique twice. FA+

Overall, Mercedes is a mostly borderline candidate, but a particularly strong performance during her teaching sample re-teach demonstrated understanding of the WTD technique.

The form mostly states the information to be taught with teacher and student actions outlined. It is vague of content and there is a check for understanding, but is also vague. During the TS, The candidate begins by explaining the lesson's objective. She refers to class notes, provided on chart paper, for the class. She requires the class to take notes. Candidate utilizes some WTD strategies during the lesson (eyes on me, etc.). She cold calls students to explain if something is literal or figurative. The candidate lectures for a significant portion of the lesson. The candidate responds appropriately to the selector's question. She wraps up the lesson by cold calling students to answer a question about literal vs figurative, but there is no individual check for understanding. During the GA, the candidate asks questions and responds positively to feedback. She struggle initially with WTD by only having some components evident. During the RT, she begins by asking students to take out handouts. Attempts to implement WTD directions by asking students to follow along silently, requiring students to use their finger to follow along, etc. The implementation is somewhat uneven, but she does demonstrate an understanding of the components. Overall, with additional support and coaching this candidate will be successful. Therefore, I recommend for admission. ",,"Cannot verify degree conferral date

She scored an FA+ in CT and TS and therefore should move on. 

In the TSPF Shelisa scored an  FA+. The TSPF is filled in logically but is missing some details about teacher action during the introduction section. The CFU seems to address the objective of distinguishing between fact and opinion in an informational text by students pulling out facts and opinions from the article and underlining them in different color highlighters

In TP Shelisa scored an FA. She was somewhat confident through out the lesson and she projected her voice with an appropriate tone. She made eye contact the entire time. She did not observe economy of language in the beginning but as the lesson progressed she did. In CA she scored an FA. She fully interpreted the objective about the difference between facts and opinions and she prioritized content on what was most important for mastery of the objective. She conveyed accurate content the entire time. In CD she scored an FA+. She clearly stated the lesson objective and she used a model of ""keyfood supermarkets have 20 isles/keyfood supermarkets are the cleanest"" to convey information. She did not ask students to support their answers with reasoning. She used examples that were in service to the objective (an advertisement) to CFU. In ES she scored an FA. All students analyzed the text once to determine facts and opinion and some students raised their hand to share answers to the questions. She answered all questions but she was slow to answer my raised hand. In MIT she scored an FA. The lesson pace was steady and she ended the lesson about 20s. early.

In the directions she presented to the group she seemed to misunderstand how to complete the activity. She stated an observable (thumbs up), it was somewhat sequential and she was specific about a timeframe (1 min). She stated to one partner to tell a specific amount of words to underline. In the direction she presented to me was missing how much time they had to share their direction. She was missing concrete elements like a behavior. She was able to implement my feedback. Her direction was also out of sequence.  She scored an FA in the GA.

In the TSRT Shelisa scored an FA+.   She gave a clear complete direction (45s. to write definition into notebook silently, thumbs up when done). She gave another direction that had two components (two minutes to write the direction on the board, thumbs up when done). ",,"pref: ENL, math, sped, d75 (has experience)

He did include a minor extra piece of information, but it was logical for the objective and content. He was not specific with what his questions would be of students nor did he explain the student and teacher actions in detail. During his teaching sample, he was confident and engaging. His tone and volume were appropriate. He did briefly turn his back to the students, but overall it was not enough to keep him out of an FA+ for teacher presence. He interpreted the objective correctly, and his content was accurate. His lesson materials were logical and related to the objective. He did not spend enough time on the ""key phrases"" part of the objective for an FA+ in content alignment, however. The lesson objective was explicitly stated at the beginning of the lesson. He used a model and presented informational lineraly to convey understanding. He attempted to check for understanding. He engaged students at least once by having them read from a handout. He also had students answer verbal questions. The lesson pace was generally steady, but he did have a rushed finish. During the group activity he stayed on topic and was able to deliver WTD directions that were specific, observable and concrete. He was also able to provide group members with actionable feedback that improved their directions. During the reteach he was able to incorporate WTD directions that were clear but not specifically academic. Also, there were some missed opportunities for more WTD directions. Overall, I feel Antony should be a part of the NYCTF program.",,"poly sci degree; couldn't locate conferral on transcript

She prioritizes content and includes examples that materials that match the objective, such as pre-teaching about opinions and facts using definition and statements about Donald Trump before having students read text and find facts and opinions in text. Patria's content delivery is an FA+, as she pushes her students to apply the skill and uses this as a clear check for understanding by having students find and apply the skill in sorting facts and opinions from the text.

The candidate was very clear with communication throughout selection day and was professional, polite, and responsive to selectors and other candidates. The candidate is overall Select - In.
Overall the TSPF was NFA. The candidate provided a TSPF with an objective to distinguish between literal and figurative language. The candidate repeated the key teaching points as an objective. The candidate planned to give a definition of hyperbole and asked students to search for examples to align to figurative language. The candidate outlined an activity for students to shares examples of literal language after the teacher defined it. The candidate does not teach the objective as a whole and leaves out part of the objective.
TP - FA+. The candidate was confident throughout the lesson and attempts to be engaging through a variation of tone. The candidate projects her voice at an appropriate volume and maintains a formal tone. the candidate maintains eye contact, even when she is writing and is almost always facing the class. The candidate speaks succinctly and clearly and demonstrates economy of language.
CA - FA. The candidate's interpretation of the provided objective is partially correct and may not address the objective fully. The candidate includes some minor pieces of extraneous content, as well as some inaccurate content (examples defined as hyperbole when they are similes). The candidate conveys other accurate content. The candidate's response to a student question partially addressed it, but affirms minor incorrect statements from students. 
CD - FA. The lesson objective is clear to students. The candidate presents information by giving definitions and examples (model) first, then uses a reading passage (poem) to practice. The candidate attempts to check for understanding by asking students to find examples in the text, but does not ask students to apply a skill or supply their response with evidence. 
ES - FA. The candidate purposefully engages most participants once and the engagement helps drive instruction forward. The candidate gives participants one way to participate (verbal). The candidate addresses questions, but not fully. The candidate had an average response time. 
MIT - FA. The candidate's pace was generally steady, but the candidate presented a rushed finish to the end of the lesson. The candidate spent a large portion of the lesson reading a long poem. The candidate spends some of the lesson time on the most important activities to advance student understanding. 
GA - FA+. The candidate's stayed on topic throughout the activity. The candidate's initial proposed directions were specific, sequential, and observable. The candidate offers both suggestions and praise for other candidates. The candidate's revised directions incorporated feedback from peers and interviewer. 
RT - FA+. The candidate incorporates WTD directions during her reteach the incorporate specific, concrete, and sequential. The candidate incorporates the skill in the most important part of th lesson. The candidate's WTD make sense and lead students to completing an academic task.",,,2.657,3.5-3.74

She turned her back to the class while modeling a formula to the class however, overall this did not detract from her lesson. She did not receive an FA+ because her economy of language was not strong. She appeared to be nervous and rambled, especially when responding to the question. Sania received in an FA in her TSO for the following reasons: Sania received an FA in CA because interpreted the objective in a way that did not allow for extraneous details however her response was unclear to the question, she was asked that ""if i stand in the sun, I'll live forever?"" but she never really clarified that photosynthesis is not for people, it's for plants, it was implied but she never explicitly stated it. She receive and FA in ES and CD because the objective was clear and she used materials to support masterly however the checks for understandings were not necessarily applying the a skill, just making a formula, FA in ES because all the students had to write down the formula however only few students actually responded to the questions. 

Group Activity: Sania was able to deliver her WTD with at least two components, specifically making them sequential and observable. The feedback she was able to give however prevents her from getting an FA+ where there were rounds where did not give feedback because the time ran out or the feedback she gave lead to little improvement of the Fellow's directions. 

Re-teach: Sania received an FA+ in her reteach because she was able to incorporate multiple components of WTD and it lead to students completing two academic tasks of charting the inputs of and outputs of photosynthesis as well as completing the formula. She did not receive an E because her directions lacked variety.

Sania is select out because her CTO is FA- because of an FA- for not submitting a lesson plan. Based on her reteach I think Sania could be worth consideration however. ",Hold All FA,"pref: English, ENL, science, sped, d75

He rates FA for TP because he was confident but his interactions were not necessarily engaging.  He projected his voice and made eye contact with S.  For CA he rates FA because he used examples that related to the lesson and he also conveyed accurate content and avoids extraneous information.  For CD, he rates FA because he presented the information linearly and the objective was mostly clear to the students.   CFU was minimal and used in the beginning to ask S what they had just done in the activity. For ES he rates FA because he gave S at least one way to participate and each S responded to his question.  For MIT he rates FA because his lesson pace was steady but he presented a rushed finish.  During the GA, he was able to give feedback to his partner that greatly improved her feedback.  Also his initial directions contained 3 the element of WTD directions.  He also offered suggestion that improves his partner's directions.  His revised directions during practice incorporated the interviewer's feedback which as to be more specific.  He rates FA+ for the GA.

The chosen objective is, students will be able to identify the parts and steps of human respiration. The key points and lesson activities are logically aligned to the objectives. Teacher and student actions are clearly listed, but do not go into a lot of detail. There are minimal expected student responses. There are ways to check for understanding listed implicitly, so it is not exactly clear if the CFU is completely aligned with the lesson objective. Matthew was confident throughout the lesson, however his interactions weren't engaging.  He maintained the same formal tone all through the lesson without being engaging.  At the start of the lesson, Matthew began by activating student's prior knowledge and explicitly stating the objectives for the students.  Matthew used an actual model made with balloons and bottles to demonstrate the way the respiratory system works as well as a drawn model with blank lines so that students could identify the parts of the system. Even though there was a worksheet for students to use to identify the parts of the system, Matthew did not explain how students should use it.  Therefore the worksheet was not used. Matthew lectured for a majority of the lesson, using the poster of the respiratory system and telling students what each part was and how each part functioned.  Student were not asked nor did they answer any questions during this portion of the lesson.  As a result, Matthew rated a FA- in engaging students.  He used models to help student understanding, but students were unable to master the objective.  This is evidenced by the fact that students could not clearly answer the questions he asked them when checking for understanding. During the group activity, Matthew remained on task and was able to incorporate all of the components of WTD. However, he did not give his partners any feedback that would help make their WTD directions better.  He did however, incorporate selector feedback. During the reteach, Matthew demonstrated that he understood WTD by saying,  ""Silently take out your worksheet diagrams, take out your pens, follow along and fill in the parts of the respiratory system.  When you are finished, put your pens down and look up at me so that I know you are finished."" These directions made sense in the context of the lesson and moved students towards the completion of an academic task.  Matthew demonstrated strengths in the are of thinking critically, but showed some significant weaknesses in the teaching sample, for these reasons, it is recommended that Matthew be a select-out candidate.",Hold All FA,"history degree conferred 5/2008

Julia logically and appropriately completes the TSPF by gradually working through the content of the lesson.
Julia was rated FA for TP because she was confident for the majority of the lesson but her interactions were not necessarily engaging.  She projected her voice loudly enough so all students could hear, her tone was formal most of the time.  She spoke succinctly but lost economy of language when speaking.  Julia was rated FA+  for CA because she conveyed accurate content during planned introduction of material which was determining the area of a triangle using a formula.  She also spent most of the time walking through how to use the formula with the example given. Julia was rated FA or CD because she attempted a CFU but ran out of time to complete it.  Furthermore she presented the material linearly which was having candidates plug information into an equation with little explanation of how to do so.  Julia was rated FA for ES because she engaged all participants in a choral response but only two of 7 candidates in participation.  She also addressed questions but had a slow response time.  Julia was rated FA or MIT because while the lesson pace was steady she did not get to fully complete her CFU within the given 5 minutes.  Julia was rated FA for GA because she stayed on topic during the activity, and understood/participated in planning for practice activity however her initial WTD directions only incorporated 2 components: sequential & observable.  While she gave logical feedback to her partners it did not necessarily make their directions more concrete, specific, observable or sequential.  She also only gave positive feedback to both partners and incorporated feedback (how students should be completing the task) but without complete accuracy.
Julia was rated  FA because she attempted to incorporate WTD directions during her reteach is slightly imperfect.  It was a poor choice of sequential directions as it was difficult for candidates to follow along.  She incorporated WTD directions in one part of the lesson, but missed other parts in the lesson where WTD directions should have been delivered.

He also addressed the whole objective and had students distinguish both figurative and literal language. Courtney stated the lesson objective to his students. He did not have a model but briefly talked about how literal and fig language could be used in a text. He mostly presented information in a linear fashion. Courtney also attempted to CFU by asking student what and why they underlined information in their text. Courtney was a FA in ES because he spent most of the lesson lecturing and then had a student read a long text for the majority of the lesson. He had minimal interactions with candidates. However, all students underlined examples in the text. and he cold called about 3 students. Lastly, he was a FA in MIT because his pace was steady and he did not refer to lesson notes.

Activities are mostly logically aligned to the objective, and CFU assesses the objective in part. FA

TP: FA
During Yannelyn's TS, she was somewhat nervous, although this did not interfere with her instruction. Her voice was appropriately projected and formal, though not necessarily engaging. She maintained eye contact with the class.
CA: FA
The objective was interpreted correctly, and all information conveyed was accurate. The response to the question was somewhat unclear, though not inaccurate. Examples and activities were mostly logical and relevant, though not necessarily geared towards mastery.
CD: FA
The objective was explicitly stated to the class. Information was presented linearly, mostly lecture style and through some questions and answers. She checked for understanding by asking students to apply the skill, although the skill was never quite clear (or demonstrated), and students were not asked to apply the skill.
ES: FA
All students worked independently on the worksheet. Some students responded to questions.
MIT: FA
The lesson pace was generally steady, with minimal stopping, although she had to cut the last activity short.
TSO: FA

During the group activity, Yannelyn participated actively. Her initial proposed direction was incomplete but was both specific and sequential. She struggled to give feedback o her partners, mostly stopping at positive feedback and then saying, ""I'm not sure about a grow..."". She struggled to incorporate feedback from the selector and did so imperfectly. FA

During her TSRT, Yannelyn used the wtd technique once to move the students toward an academic task. Her direction was specific/concrete and observable. She missed other parts of the lesson where the technique could have been used. FA

One flag about her GPA explanation: she states that her low GPA is due to her weaknesses in math and science, but a cursory review of her transcript reveals low grades across the board, including in humanities classes (although the math and science classes are significantly lower).

Overall, Yannelyn is a borderline candidate. There were minor critical thinking concerns during the group activity, although this may have been due to nerves (incomplete initial direction, struggling to give feedback to her partners). Her TP was decent during the sample lesson, although this actually got worse as the night went on. With all borderline results, she is a select out, although she could possibly be coached to be more successful. Please review.",Hold: All FA,"prefers english but no degree

Her TSPF earned an FA. Most of her key points were aligned and her CFU was logical and addressed the objective, by asking students to find a main idea and supporting details of a text. However, her actions, specifically underlining the first line of a text to find the main idea isn't necessarily relevant, as the main idea of a text is not always in the first line. The TS earned an FA+ overall. The weakness was in her TP. She was visibly nervous throughout the entire TS, speaking very quickly throughout the entire less so that it was hard to understand what she was saying. Her tone was formal and her voice was loud enough, and she did maintain eye contact with the students. However she rambled occasionally, interrupting the flow of her lesson with ""ums"" often. In CA, Zakiya earned a FA+. She reviewed the objective with students before beginning. She used two examples to help students understand the definitions on her anchor chart-- the title of a movie and legs of a table. In CD, Zayika earned an FA- She put up the definitions of a main idea and supporting details on the board and had students share their own personal definitions of what they might think main idea and detail means. She doesn't use a model to determine how to determine the main idea and supporting details. Her lesson, however, focuses on what main idea and supporting details are, without how to find them. She does check for understanding by asking students to find supporting details, but never models how to do that within the text. In ES, she earned an FA+. She cold called and accepted volunteers for answers. She also had students write down potential supporting details in their graphic organizers and answered all questions as they arose. In MIT, Zayika earned an FA+. Most of the lesson is spent on the most important activities, but she spends the majority of the time. Students don't complete the graphic organizer activity, as the conclusion was a bit shortened, but the lesson pace felt steady.

In the GA, Zayika earned an FA. She delivered strong feedback to her partner, helping her create a more specific direction. In her original revised direction, she included two components of WTD-- specific and observable. However, her direction was confusing as she attempted to understand the students who were distracted by saying ""I know you guys near this half of the room are distracted by the blinds."" Nonetheless, she adjusted to her partner's feedback in using economy of language by removing that section in her revision. She did not entirely incorporate my feedback of using an observable direction in her revision. In her RT, Zayika earned an FA. She incorporated two components of WTD-- specific and observable in her re-teach, as she had her students put their pencils down when they were done copying the title of the article in their graphic organizer. She attempts to use WTD directions again, by giving the directions for the rest of the activity, but they were not clear and logical-- she wanted her students to find supporting details and then put their pencils down again. 

Overall, Zayika is a select-out candidate because she earned an FA in her TS, in CT, and TP. Her visible nervous energy affected her TP and CD in her TS, her ability to complete the GA  effectively and RT.  She did however offer valuable feedback to her partner and did well in ES.

Esmir's main issue was not fulfilling this objective.  Esmir's ratings are based mainly on the fact that he did not utilize an informational text because he used a worksheet instead of some form of literature.  Because the candidate did not receive an FA+ in anything except ES, he does not qualify to be selected in.  Of major concern to me, although not on any of the rubrics, is the many grammatical and spelling mistakes made on his TSPF and worksheet.  He communicated well during the lesson, hence the FA in CS.  Moreover, candidate was not fully engaged in the GA and did not provide any original piece of feedback to his partners.  As such, based on the rubric, this candidate should be selected out and placed on hold.  I will request a peer review for this as well.","After reviewing this candidate's ratings, I believe they are accurate. This candidate should be put on hold. ","cult studies: 6/2008

It is completed logically, and student practice is included. Teacher and student actions are present but not explained in detail. There is a CFU at the end. Most key points are aligned to the objective. CA is a weak FA, as there is misalignment between what is taught- too much content took over the explanation of the steps of respiration. There are no errors in what was taught, but there is significant extraneous content that took away from student practice and student engagement- this weakened his CD and ES. I want with FA because of the lack of errors, but there were some weaknesses here. In TP he was FA as well. There were not attempts to be engaging but he was confident, easy to hear and he made eye contact. There were some attempts and econ of language, but there was also some lecturing. In CD, the objective about the steps of respiration was stated and the candidate used a model. He also asked students to support responses with evidence, but verbally sharing all of the info about respiration prevented students from identifying key ideas. There is some FA+ evidence, but the presence of extraneous content made assessment and mastery difficult. ES is also FA, as student labeled a diagram but did not use the diagram in any academic way- the candidate did a significant amount of sharing information. He answered all questions, and did ask students questions and they raised their hands- so again, some FA+ and FA- evidence. MIT was unremarkable, FA. Michael's participation in the GA was FA. Although his directions were strong and he understands the technique he struggled to collaborate with peers and seemed slightly resistant to my feedback. I have concerns about his ability to engage in activities like this one because he was not engaged with the group- staring off into space and only giving feedback to one other person out of three. He was able to include three component of WTD, but because of weak participation he is FA. Michale's TSRT demonstrated that he does not have a full understanding of WTD- he used the technique to teach his lesson again. Overall, select out because he is an all-FA candidate. My concern was his lack of engagement in the GA- not enough to be a professionalism concern but he struggled to receive and give feedback, which is key. He wasn't negative about it just uninterested.  ",Hold All FA,Math Immersion-- Calculus grade B+,3.1,3.5-3.74

His objective was mostly clear and content was presented linearly, without using a model (CD - FA). Rolando attempted to CFU in part by having some students answer questions. Most students were engaged through questioning, but there was no other way to participate (ES - FA). His interpretation of the objective was not correct or complete. Literal language was mentioned at the beginning, but the lesson focused on distinguishing similes from metaphors. Candidate made a minor misstatement and affirmed an incorrect response (CA - FA-).

Candidates were slightly confused by some of her examples, though the examples were logical given the objective. Nikita kept asking questions such as ""What is Amy being compared to?"" without explaining that a simile would be an example of figurative language. She also did not incorporate an examples of literal language, which was part of the chosen objective. Due to this, she was FA- in CA. With respect to CD, Nikita's CFU did not assess the objective. Her CFU required students to fill in the blanks for the two poems students had read, but did not assess whether they could distinguish between literal and figurative language. Instead, students chose between answers such as ""LeBron James is being compared to a giraffe."" As a result, key ideas were unclear and she earned an FA- in CD. In terms of ES, Nikita was FA: she purposefully engaged all students once by having them fill in a cloze activity and gave most participants more than one way to participate (verbal and writing). With respect to MIT, Nikita referred to lesson notes, though the pacing was generally steady so she was FA.

In the GA, Nikita's initial directions were specific, sequential and observable. However, she was only able to offer positive feedback and struggled significantly to incorporate staff feedback. She took a long pause (the feedback was ""change your observable"") and ultimately said, ""turn to your partner"" after the other candidates tried to help her with cues. She was therefore FA in the GA.  

In the TSRT, Nikita was FA. She attempted to incorporate WTD at two points in her lesson, but the attempts were imperfect and did not demonstrate a clear understanding of the technique. ",,"prefers ENL but does not have language credits

Angela's TSPF lacked detail and was FA. She said what students and the teacher would be doing generally, but did not provide specifics in content or process. In her lesson delivery on latitude and longitude, she had FA projection and confidence, but maintained her back to the audience for most of the lesson. She was overall FA in TP due to strengths in projection and confidence. She fully addresed her objective, but she had one example that seemed to be completely incorrect (she abandonded it saying ""that's wrong, let's move on,) but her examples were otherwise logical and relevant. She is FA- in CD because she stated her objective, but she lacked a CFU and presented her ideas in a confusing way. During the GA, she gave some logical glows and grows, but misunderstood the activity in general by giving narrative of her  classroom ""I will ask them to be quiet, I will hand out the papers..."" rather than scripting a direction. She fixed it during the feedback-from-me activity, and was able to implement my feedback to add concrete details about how the students should be writing in their notebooks. During the TSRT, she did not demonstrate understanding of the WTD technigue - she said ""Try plotting those two points and as soon as you find where that point is, raise your hand.

However after reading his lesson plan in full and watching him do his lesson plan today where he clearly stated that his lesson was about the Senate and the House of Reps. I think he just accidentally chose the wrong objective from the drop down menu. 

Teaching Sample: Nathan received an E in TP because he was very confident, maintained eye contanct, projected his voice, and employed economy of language. Overall Nathan received an E in not only TP but in CD and ES as well. The objective was clear, he provided multiple ways for students to be engaged, (reading, writing, and speaking) and included clear checks for understand that would lead to mastery of the objective. The reason why he received an FA in MIT is because he was not able to comp his lesson and FA in CA because he only addressed part of the objective, all his content (even though it was in the worksheet) that he was able to get through during the lesson was for the House of Reps and not the Senate.

Group Activity: Nathan was the first to give his WTD directions which clearly incorporated 3 out of the components of WTD and he was able to give actionable feedback to his partners. Therefore he received an E in the GA because after he revised his directions he was able to incorporate all 4.  

Reteach: Nathan received an FA+ because he was able to incorporate at least 2 components of WTD and was able to apply it to an academic task. He gave directions multiple times like ""raise a straight vertical hand"" ""everyone put their pen on the first paragraph"" etc. however he did not offer a variety of directions within the components to warrant an E. ","After reviewing Alyssa's, I am going to move forward with a Select Out decision for Nathan because he did not use an objective on the list. This is an old objective from last year’s list. It’s clear that he did not do this work himself. ","Prefers ELA, SPED-ELA, SPED-SS (not qualified for English/SPED-English)

All of the lesson activities were not aligned to the objective and the CFU addressed areas not stated in the objective.  During the TS his TP was FA.  He was a little nervous in the lesson but it did not detract from the delivery of the lesson.  EOL was a weakness throughout, but he spoke clearly and succulently.  His TSO was FA-.  He was teaching about using longitude and latitude to find locations.  He spent a significant amount of time discussing the earth rotation and why we use degrees, minutes and seconds to measure the long and lat.  This was not aligned to the objective and most of his questions were not aligned to the objective.  (CA- FA-).  He only talked about the skill and did not model how to find the long and lat of a space and his CFU did not address the full objective and was misaligned. (CD- FA-).  There was minimal interaction with the students and he only had the students answer a few questions.  They had a worksheet but they did not use the worksheet to be engaged in the content.  (ES-FA-). For MIT the lesson was stead but there was a misallocation of lesson activities and there was a part of the lesson he did not get to.  During the GA he struggled to show a clear understanding of WTD.  During the feedback portion he only provided the group was glows and during one partner he was silent. He final set of directions were not concrete or specific and the observables were imperfect. (FA-).  During the reteach he continued to show a misunderstanding of the purpose of WTD.  There were times the directions were confusing and the addition of the directions made the content more confusing.  He was attempting to use another candidates WTD (who had the same objective) in his reteach, but did so imperfectly. (FA-) Overall I do not recommend him to the program because of low TSO and CTO.

However, she should be reviewed due to her performance in the GA and TSRT.

Alleyne earned an FA- on the TSPF. Most key points were aligned to the objective, however activities were not explained in any detail so it was not clear whether the CFU or planned activities were aligned to the objective. As an example, she wrote, ""students will be given an in class activity"" but did not explain what the activity involved. 

Overall, Alleyne earned an FA- on her TS. Alleyne earned an FA+ in TP. She was confident, projected her voice and maintained eye contact, but did not demonstrate economy of language. With respect to CA, Alleyne conveyed accurate information, but not all of her key points were aligned to the objective. Alleyene's interpretation of the objective ""identify producers, consumers, and decomposers in a food web and put them in sequence according to the flow of energy"" was somewhat correct, but her lesson included a lot of extraneous information about trophic levels. Overall she earned an FA. In terms of CD, Alleyne was FA- largely because she talked about content and did not check for understanding. Alleyne presented so much information during her lesson that she impeded mastery of her chosen objective. Alleyne earned an FA- in MIT because the lesson pacing was misallocated. At 5 minutes, she was in the middle of an explanation of the trophic levels of the Energy Pyramid. There was no student practice or CFU due to this mismanagement of time. With respect to ES, Alleyne gave students a Do Now, cold called one student to answer and asked for a volunteer. She therefore engaged all students at least once and gave two ways participate.

During the GA, Alleyne's initial directions were specific, sequential and concrete. She gave her partner feedback that helped improve his directions and after some hesitation, was able to incorporate staff feedback and earned an FA+.

During the TSRT Alleyne delivered a set of WTD directions that met two components of WTD (specific, concrete) that led students to complete an academic task. She therefore earned an FA+.","TSO warranted a comprehensive rating of FA-. Candidate's TP was positive, but all other components of her TS did not meet the bar.

His application materials included a below-model GPA as well as some negative evidence in his essays.

Alan's teaching sample provided weak evidence, earning FA-. For TP, he was confident for most of the lesson, though appeared nervous and used an informal tone at points. He did encourage students to participate by varying his tone. Alan's content was accurate and he interpreted the objective correctly, but he did not convey sufficient content for students move toward mastery. Alan's sequencing activity was confusing to participants. He presented content linearly and did not model a food web. His CFU attempted to have students apply a skill (CD). Everyone was engaged in working with a partner to sequence, but that was about the only opportunity to engage (ES). There was a slightly rushed finish to the lesson, which cut off a planned CFU (MIT).

Alan's TSPF demonstrated FA CT, as key points and activities related to his objective of sequencing the food web. Alan was FA for the group activity, he stayed on topic and his initial directions included specific and observable elements. He was unable to give partners constructive feedback. During the coaching conversation, Alan displayed some confusion when I asked where else he could apply the skill. During the re-teach, he applied WTD somewhat illogically and missed opportunities to show understanding.",,"english degree; can't locate conferral date on transcript

TSPF CT: FA- Kevin's lesson plan was not appropriately and logically completed, as there is misalignment between the objective and his key points.  The objective asks students to be able to classify, however, nothing in his lesson indicates that students will do any of this, only that they will take notes down and answer questions.  There is vague reference to what students would be doing (taking notes/answering questions) and does not contain evidence of student practice.  There is a basic CFU planned.  TP: FA Kevin was slightly nervous, quavering voice and shaking, and his interactions weren't engaging, although it didn't interfere with his lesson.  He projected his voice and could be heard, maintaining a formal tone.  He made eye contact with students, but lost EOL when he paused to think.  CA: FA- His interpretation of the objective was mostly correct, but he didn't address it completely.  He included information that wasn't necessary for mastery of the objective and he conveyed accurate information.  CD: FA- The objective was clear to students because he stated it.  He presented information linearly and used questioning, but didn't model.  There was no CFU. ES: FA- Kevin minimally interacted with his students, just asking them basic questions, such as the colored boxes on the periodic table, which didn't move them forward in terms of completing an academic task.  He lectured for the entire time.  MIT: FA The lesson was generally steady and there was no real rush to finish.  He did refer to his lesson notes, but it neither stopped nor did it slow down significantly the lesson.  GA CT: FA Kevin's initial WTD instructions were incomplete, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the concept or he struggled for the planning for practice.  His instruction didn't include any aspect of WTD, although by the end, he was able to incorporate accurately my feedback and the feedback provided by his partners.

Regarding the TSPF, this is a reading objective and there is no reading mentioned- get main idea and supporting details from an informational text . The lesson is written as compare and contrast. There is no text mentioned, which means that the candidate significantly misunderstands the objective and key points are not aligned or connected to the selected objective. Overall, this candidate is FA- because of the misalignment of the planning form. Activities and content are logical, but again, misaligned to the objective. FA- instead of FA because the form is logically completed and there is a CFU present. Overall, Hasani's TS was very weak, which was also evident in his lesson plan. His TP is FA, as he was mostly confident but not engaging. He was audible and mostly formal, and he made eye contact. Although he was visibly nervous at times, this wasn't consistently a problem. There was no economy of language, as he lectured the class for more than half the lesson. However, this was not the most evident weakness. CA is NFA, as the objective asked students to read a nonfiction text and ID the main idea and the students read no text. Instead, the candidate asked students to complete a T-chart about monarchies and democracies. His interpretation of the provided objective was completely incorrect  and the content was irrelevant. Students were confused because there was more lecturing than student activities and students only engaged in a Q and A with the candidate- what are some examples of a monarchy? was the only engagement that happened. Students were not asked to take notes, and there was a significant amount of lecturing, so ES is FA-. In CD the candidate is also FA-, as he did not directly share an objective and asked students questions, using their prior knowledge instead of sharing content- he talked about content but did not model it. The CFU (what are some examples of monarchies?) did not assess the objective. Additionally, students did not read anything, which the objective specifically asks for. MIT was FA, as he finished his lesson 30 seconds early, did not refer to notes and had a generally steady pace. This TS was very weak as the objective was misaligned from the start. Hasani's participation in the GA was strong relative to the rest of the event. He was able to use three components of WTD in his initial directions. However, his feedback to his colleagues was generally positive and did not make anyone's directions stronger. He did not meet the bar for FA+ because he did not have all of the FA indicators present.

Candidates major issue was in her TSPF and CA.  Candidates TSPF objective did not align with the key points.  Planned activities and key points indicates that candidate significantly misunderstands how to complete the planning form and lesson objective.  Student actions are not entirely clear regarding annotations, and completion of a graphic organizer.  Planned activities do not appear logically aligned since the overall objective is informational text discussed at all.  Moreover, the activities of listening to a long worksheet, then annotating the text, and then circling key vocabulary words, followed by completing a graphic organizer would take significantly longer than the time allotted.  As such, throughout the delivery of the lesson, the candidate did not utilize the informational text at all in the manner stated in the lesson plan.  The only use of the informational text was for one student to read from a small portion.  Most of the rest of the information on the worksheet was on poster board paper  thereby making it unnecessary to annotate any of the information.  For these reasons, the candidate received an NFA in TSPF and CA with an FA- on CD.  These reasons alone automatically causes candidate to fall into the Select Out category.  The TSOR is NFA due to the NFA of CA. and the CTOR is NFA due to the NFA of the TSPF.

Additionally, candidate did not teach the lesson provided on the TSPF.  The TSPF stated the objective was determining main idea from informational text but the lesson presented was determining the five stages of a story.  Additionally, the entire lesson presented incorrectly named stages of a story, which affected content delivery as well.

TP was a strength for Adrian. He was FA+ because he was confident, projected his voice and maintained eye contact with students. He did not, however consistently demonstrate economy of language. 

Adrian's TS overall was FA due to a weakness in CD. With respect to ES, Adrian called on two students to complete a problem at the board and took volunteers for questions he asked at the end of his TS.

Megan's planning form scored a NFA because her objective was not aligned to her lesson. She picked an objective about an informative text but wrote a lesson plan about the three branches of government. 
Megan's teaching sample was weak. Megan scored a FA in TP because she was able to project her voice and maintain eye contact. However, she seemed very nervous and was pacing from side to side at the start of the lesson. She spoke very loudly and at times her volume increase to an uncomfortable level. She made eye contact with students throughout the lesson and did not turn her back to the class. Megan was a NFA for CA because her objective was not clear to participants or selectors. All her lesson activities were not aligned to the provided objective. Most of her lesson was extraneous content for example, information about the census, students future voting, the current election, the definition of articles, implied powers, improper clauses. Megan was a FA- in CD because she did not provide a model or ask students questions during her lesson. She also lectured and talked about extraneous details and did not provide any examples. Megan scored a FA- during ES because she had minimal engagement with participants. She lectured for more than half the lesson. Megan was a FA MIT because her pace was steady and she did not stop the lesson to refer to the notes. 
During the group activity, Megan was a FA because she included two components of WTD (seq and concrete). She provided a glow and grow to her partners, but often rambled and gave unclear directions showing some confusion about WTD. 
During the reteach, Megan only stated one WTD direction and then asked if she should keep teaching the lesson. During the interview, Megan had clear communication skills. However, Megan was slightly unprofessional during several parts of the interview process. For example, during two candidates reteaches, Megan monopolized the reteach by asking candidates questions and pretending to be a small confused child. The selectors had previously stated not to ask candidates questions during their lesson. During the group activity, Megan was confused and asked to look at the partner's worksheet. In a very harsh tone she replied, ""I WAS LISTENING. I'm a visual learner."" Also, once each group member had restated their WTD, Megan started talking to her partner. The selector implied that everyone needed to be quiet and she started to whisper to her partner. Again, the selector said that until the other group is finished, everyone should silent. 

I do not recommend, Megan for NYCTF due to professionalism concerns and her NFA in TSO rating and CTO.

He talked about the content, but there was no modeling and there was a perfunctory, but incomplete CFU.  ES: FA- His interactions were minimal with students and only 4/6 students participated and only through answering questions.  He also lectured for the entire lesson.  MIT: FA- The lesson's pacing was completely misallocated, as he used all his time to introduce information.  GA CT: FA- Jonathan didn't understand the WTD skill and was unable to give feedback.  He struggled and was confused at certain points and his initial WTD instruction only comprised of an observable step.  He misunderstood my feedback to him and misunderstood the scenario, despite having it explained to him.  TSRT CT: FA+ Jonathan accurately incorporated two WTD instructions that helped to move his students forward and complete an academic task.  They made sense within the context of the lesson and he incorporated them when necessary.","QC CTO (FA overall but more than one FA- rating. Should be FA- overall)

He maintained eye contact the entire time and he observed economy of language at most points. In CA he scored an FA+. He fully interpreted the objective of multiplying binomials and he prioritized time on multiplying binomials. He used examples that were in service to the objective. In CD he scored an FA. He used a model to convey how to multiply binomials but the process was somewhat unclear to participants. He used materials that support mastery of the objective.  He had 2 CFU of completing practice questions. He did not ask for evidence. In ES he scored an FA+. All students answered practice problems, some students wrote the answer on the board. In MIT he scored an E. He presented a completed lesson as evidenced on the planning form and no time was wasted. Overall in the TS he scored an FA+ in the TS. 

In the GA Andy scored an FA. In the direction he shared with the group it was missing some elements. It was out of sequence. He was missing a behavior for how they should take the notes. He gave only positive feedback to both of his partners. In the direction he presented to me he was missing some specific elements of how the students should be writing their notes in their notebook. He was able to implement my feedback into the direction.

Tasfia called on all students once, but the students only had one way to participate, which was verbally. Additionally, she did not acknowledge my hand when it was raised to answer a question. I raised it two different times.  MIT was FA-. Tasfia paused in the lesson, and didn't speak for about 10 seconds, but the students were not asked to do anything during that time.

If you have a question, please raise your hand. Please wait on me to call on you. Thumbs up if you do."" These did not move students towards completing an academic task, nor do they demonstrate that Tasfia understands the WTD technique.

In the TSPF Kurtis scored an FA. Some student action and teacher action is explained in detail. He stated that students will ""their insight on the subject."" The planned activity of students answering the practice problem seems to address the objective. 

In TP Kurtis scored an FA-. He was visibly nervous during the lesson and he rambled occasionally. He spoke with a breathy tone. In CA he scored an FA. He fully interpreted the objective of finding the area of a triangle. He conveyed one minor inaccuracy by stating that ""LxW is perimeter"". He then correctly stated the formula for area of the triangle. In CD he scored an FA. The lesson objective of what is area was clear to participants. He modeled one example and then he had students complete a practice problem on their own. He also asked questions such as ""What is the definition of area?"" and ""what is the base of this triangle"". In ES he scored and FA+. All students solved a practice problem and all students wrote down their own definition of area. He answered all questions as they arose. In MIT he scored an FA. The lesson pace was steady but he stretched the practice time. Overall he scored an FA in the TS. 

In the GA Kurtis scored an FA-. He provided positive feedback to his partner stating he liked how he had all the elements and that they put their pen in the air. He suggested to his partner to place the homework silently on their desk as a way to make it more specific. In the direction he presented to me it included all elements. He self deliberated and suggested to the group to add a time into his direction. In the direction he presented to me  he was missing the second part of the redirection (how does want students to read along with him). He didn't understand the scenario. He was able to incorporate my feedback of how to read.

During the TSRT, Richard's WTD directions were somewhat imperfect--they were concrete, sequential, and observable, but they were mixed in with some lecturing of content, leading to some mild confusion. He used the directions twice but missed other parts where it might have been appropriate (switching back into lecture mode). FA

One flag: he included his PhD transcript but does not include his undergraduate transcript (explains that it is not available digitally and that he will submit it when his request for the physical copy has been processed).

Throughout the event, Richard participated with professionalism. His teaching sample indicated a strong understanding of his content area, but his TP unfortunately interfered with his instruction--possibly due to nerves, although this continued throughout the event. This improved slightly during his re-teach, though not enough to pull him out of the FA-.

He spoke very fast and it was very challenging to determine what he was saying as all his words were mumbled and together. He also turned his back for long intervals during the lesson and only sometimes made eye contact. Malcolm scored a FA+ for CA because he used examples of facts and opinions and conveyed correct content. He also addressed all parts of the objective and had students distinguish between informative and factual texts. He scored a FA in CD because the objective was clear and he presented information in a linear way - first stating definitions and then providing examples. He attempted to CFU by asking some students to distinguish between fact or opinions in a text. Malcolm was a FA in ES because he cold called some students to read from his definition poster and asked some students to answer questions about the text. Lastly, Malcolm was a FA in MIT because his pace was steady. During the group activity Malcolm was very hard to understand, but included a time limit and visual in his direction. He asked a partner how they would know the students were done but did not make a full suggestion of how to improve their direction. During the reteach (FA), Malcolm was able to include one WTD at the start of his lesson but he missed some opportunities to include WTD (for example, when students were cold called).

During the re-teach (FA+), Jillian provided two strong WTD directions and both directions helped drive instruction (how to complete worksheet and what to do when you agree with the speaker). During the interview, Jillian was professional and had clear communication skills. 

Due to her NFA in the teaching sample planning form and weak score in CA due to alignment, Jillian should not be accepted into the NYCTF program.

He did not interpret this objective correctly. He provided no historical text to students and they did not address point of view in anyway. He also stated incorrect information. He stated the social means interactions between two people and this is entirely separate from political which is about government. This is not accurate. During the CFU, either political or social were acceptable answers and students did not know what to do because they felt both were accurate. He said that one is accurate and one is not and just moved on. The materials were not in service to the objective even just basing it on the incomplete interpretation of the objective. His inaccurate interpretation of the objective also earned him an NFA in TSPF. Overall he earned an NFA in TP because of the FNA in CA. 

Timothy did better in the group activity. He was able to incorporate a clear observable and elements of concrete. He gave peers specific and constructive feedback consistently. He struggled a little to incorporate my feedback during the group activity, but there was clear effort and an understanding of WTD. I wanted him to tell students to pick up their pencils before telling them to write, but instead he clarified what main idea was. He did follow my feedback in that he tried to tell students something they needed in order to be able to underline, but he did not say pencil. He still earned an FA+ because it still made sense. He also earned an Fa+ in the reteach because he incorporated two components of WTD and the directions allowed for students to complete the table on page 2 far more easily. He could have added more which kept him out of E. Overall his CT is still an NFA due to the NFA in TSPF.

Overall I cannot recommend Timothy to the program because of his TSPF and CA today. There was a clear issue that stemmed from his interpretation of the objective. He took a drop down objective and created his own objective from it which automatically makes him NFA in our model.",,"BA Criminal Justice conferred May 2006

Her tone of voice was at an appropriate tone.  She made eye contact most of the time but often looked down at her watch during her TS. Rachel was rated FA- for CA because the interpretation of the provided objective is mostly correct but does not address the objective fully.  During her TS Rachel never explained how students should use words and phrases to determine the author's POV.  She also included minor pieces of extraneous information including connotation in word choice.  Furthermore her response to the question I posed was unclear, I asked how do we know an author's POV and she responded with telling me what the POV was from the author of her sample text.  Rachel was rated FA- for CD because Rachel talks about content but does not model it.  She told us what POV was but she never modeled how to use words and phrases to help determine it.  Furthermore she had candidates read a text independently and underline words or phrases that could help them determine the author's POV.  Rachel was rated  FA- for ES because she had minimal interaction with participants.  She also lectured for more than half the lesson.  She called on 2 of 7 participants and it was for minimal responses. Rachel was rated FA-  for MIT because the lesson pace was uneven.  Rachel spent a significant amount of time for candidates to work on a worksheet and spoke very quickly prior to that.  Rachel was rated FA for GA because her initial proposed directions during planning for practice accurately incorporated 2 components of WTD (concrete & specific).  During feedback she gave logical feedback to her partners after she was questioned by her partner who she initially only gave positive feedback to.  Her revised directions during practice accurately incorporated feedback which was to make it observable.  Rachel was rated FA for TSRT because she accurately incorporated WTD in her teaching sample re-teach in a way that demonstrated a clear understanding of the technique and used 2 components of WTD: Concrete & Specific.

Nargiza's TSPF earned an FA rating. Her objective was to define and describe the process of respiration. However, she started to include key points in her planning form that had to do with defining and discussing pnemonia and the social and emotional effects of pnemonia, which were not key points related to her objective. Within her teaching sample itself, Nargiza spent 4 minutes solely lecturing without stopping to ask any clarifying questions or elicit checks for understing and from the students. While she had a worksheet for the students to follow along with numbers regarding the different parts involved in breathing and respiration, it was not also posted up and modeled for the students. Rather, the candidate lectured throughout the worksheet talking about the content. The key ideas and information was presented in a confusing way. Therefore, she earned an FA- in CD. Her CA  earned  a FA -rating. She interprets the first part of the objective correctly in discussing what respiration is and how it is different from breathing and her first handout with the pictures of the different parts of the body involved in the process are mostly logical and relevant. She understands and provides accurate information regarding the content.However, she then brings up pneumonia and asks students how they think they get pneumonia and what parts of the body are involved in pneumonia. Not only is this extraneous information not aligned to the objective, but it also does not match what was planned in the lesson where students will read an information text about pneumonia. Her questions that she did ask centered around pneumonia at 1:21 left of the lesson. After discussing pneumonia, she briefly and abruptly ended the lesson with ""any questions, ok that's it"". While she does answer the question I had asked to clarify within the lesson, there were no clear checks for understanding and no engagement of students other than volunteered responses that were on pneumonia, which was the extraneous information. Therefore, she is an FA- in engaging students due to her lecturing for the majority of the lesson. She earns an FA in MIT due to her rushed finish at the end of the lesson. Nargiza also struggled during the group activity. While she did provide a glow and a grow, she failed to write a direction that incorporated my feedback of making her directions more specific regarding the statement "" Everyone inlcuding those who do not have necessary materials ready,"" for her overall, revised WTD direction stated as Everyone including those who do not have materials ready. Tkae their pencils and take two minutes to copy their directions from the board and once they are done then show a thumbs up."" When she delivered her re-teach using a WTD, 2 students raised their hand to answer questions because they were unclear of what she wanted them to do on the worksheet. She stated, ""Since we learned about different parts that are responsible for respiration. i want you to take your pencil and mark the parts for avoli and larynx and mark the parts for the parts for respiration.when you are done, eyes on me.

She planned activities for students to engage in, but the planning form does not indicate clear activities or models that will lead students towards mastery of the objective.

I raised my hand to ask a question and had my hand up for 45 seconds before she looked up and noticed me. When I asked her what ""false"" means, which was on the board for both of her definitions (fact and opinion), she stated that a fact is something that is not true.  She asked for volunteers to answer questions and read the definitions on the board, but the students were not engaged in activities that moved them towards mastery of the objective.  She read a passage extremely quickly, so it was difficult for students to understand. She then asked them three questions at once: What was this passage about? Can you tell me a fact? Or an opinion?

However, Eden did have a TSPF that had a clear objective with key points aligned to the objective. Her key points include facts and opinion, however she mentions homework. Teacher and students actions were double planned and detailed in the sense that she provided detailed information for what she will be asking and what the students should be saying and doing in there part of the lesson. Eden uses a model on the board of two different pieces of paper to sort out the different defintions of fact and opinion. She states her objective to be able to tell the difference between fact and opinion in the beginning of the lesson and also posts an explict objective on the board for the students to see. Throughout her lesson, all of her information was aligned to the key points and the objective. She did not include any other erroneous details or information throughout her lesson and did incoroporate text that was logical to use for her objective.  She engages all the students at least twice through verbal and volunteer responses. All students get called on to provide a response. When she asks a question, she has the students provide evidence or an example for why they chose either fact or opinion. Eden solely relies on speaking about penguins and she does not have them apply this skill of distinguishing between fact and opinion to any different topic other than penguins. Eden is a strong candidate in all other areas, as her group activity and critical thinking skills all earned FA+. Had Eden decided to have the students apply the skill to a differnet topic, she would have earned an FA+ in Content Delivery, rather than the FA she earned. This would have also increased her lesson time. Eden could be a strong candidate due to all of her critical thinking ratings and her FA+ ratings throuhgout TSPF, TP, CA, ES.","Eden finished her teaching sample in less than 3 minutes.

She received an FA- in CA because she used poems for both the literal and figurative language. Using a poem to demonstrate literal language is confusing because of the minor bird in the Robert Frost poem was symbolic of something else but she continued to state that poem was simply about a bird. Using poetry for your literal language example is confusing for students because when they eventually do read other poems that appear to be literal, they will take the poem at face value instead of reading for symbolism or deeper meaning. Also the candidate finished her lesson with a 1:15 left on the timer, giving her a FA- in MIT. Therefore she is a FA- in TSO.

Group Activity: Shana was able to incorporate multiple components of WTD: Open to page 2, eyes on me when done. She was also able to incorporate the feedback of using a new observable. She only gave positive feedback which resulted in her receiving an FA.

ReTeach: During the ReTeach she was able to incorporate multiple components of WTD: ""take out poetry worksheet, put on your desk so i know that you're ready."" Gave another set of directions but was unable to write them down because she spoke very fast, from what I could hear while I was typing I could tell they also incorporated at least 2 if not 3 components.

She checks for understanding multiple times and asks students to support their answer with evidence each time. Alexandra spikes in ES. She engages all participants at twice by having them copy the definition , answer questions, and through choral response. She also asks for volunteers and cold calls participants. She addressed all question when they arose. MIT: FA+  Lesson pace is steady. She finishes lesson using time allotted, nearly all of the lesson time is spent on the most important activities. During the GA candidate's initial WTD included 3 components of WTD and she accurately incorporates feedback from interviewer. however, she offered only positive feedback to her peers.  During her RT Alexandra demonstrates a deep understanding of WTD. She used WTD in her original TS before the GA. In her RT she incorporated WTD in multiple sections of her lesson which led students toward completing an academic task. Throughout the selection event, Alexandra is warm and professional.

","Although Alexandra performed well on selection day, her gpa did not show consistent improvement throughout the years. She explained that her first year was the hardest for her, as she was the first to go to college and not in the best major for herself. However, after her first year, although her grades started to improve, there were still dips throughout her college career. Even as she looks to secure her 2nd degree, her gpa still falls below a 3.0, making it very difficult to advocate for her, and leads me to reverse this decision.

Lauren's TSO earned an FA-. In TP, Lauren earned an FA. She maintained eye contact throughout the teaching sample and used a formal tone. However, she was visibly nervous at points, pausing with ""ums"" and often was overly-wordy with her explanations, specifically around her definitions of main idea and supporting details.  In CA, Lauren earned an FA-. Her objective was to distinguish between a main idea and supporting detail, but she simply provided the definitions of each three separate times-- in the review of prior knowledge, the activity, and in the closing. She never attempted to teach the class how to distinguish between the two, not addressing the full objective. Her response to my question was unclear, as I asked ""How can you tell the difference between a main idea and a supporting detail?"" and she simply repeated the definitions, giving an inaccurate definition of ""supporting detail"" as-- ""something that explains the main idea."" In CD, Lauren earned an FA-. She does not model how to find a main idea or supporting detail in a paragraph and the way in which she introduces materials impedes on the mastery of the objective. Her definition of a supporting detail did not support students finding it, as students would point to any other line in the reading that wasn't the main idea. She did attempt to check for understanding by asking ""what is the main idea?"" and ""what is a detail that supports it?"" but she never had students explain their answers. The activity would not lead to mastery of the objective. In MIT, Lauren earned an FA+. Her pace is steady and her conclusion is not rushed, but feels shortened, as she repeats the definition of the main idea and supporting detail to the class. She finished ~10s early. In ES, Lauren earned an FA+  She had many different ways in which students could participate in the lesson-- coming up to the board, holding up 'yes"" or ""no"" cards and responding to cold call questions, but aside from coming to the board, students did not demonstrate academic thinking. For her ""yes"" or ""no"" cards, she simply had students show whether they agreed or disagree with the answer given, without having them explain their thinking. 

In CT, Lauren earned an FA. In the GA, Lauren earned an FA. At times, she only presented positive feedback to her peers (2/3 times). In her original response, she used three components of WTD-- specific, concrete, and observable. However, she did not fully apply my feedback of making a part of her direction more specific and sequential. In her RT, Lauren earned an FA. She used two components of WTD-- specific and observable, but it does not lead to completing an academic task, as students are simply taking out their yes/no cards. She completed her RT within 1 minute and seemed to give up towards the end, rolling her shoulders back, sighing, and shrugging at me. 

Lauren's seemingly defeated attitude towards the end, only one FA+ in any component, and an inability/confusion around applying feedback are serious concerns to her ability to be a successful teacher for NYC students. Lauren is a select-out candidate as she did not excel in any one particular area and seemed to give up when applying feedback.

During her Re-Teach, Sasha only incorporated one aspect of What to Do; she gave time  frames to students for completing tasks but focused on the content of the lesson and the engagement of students, rather than giving clear, concrete, sequential, or observable directions.

He then refers to a sports analogy to explain neutron. The candidate is capable to correctly respond to the question. He spends a significant portion of the class making analogies between the parts of an atom, but virtually no time is given to actually providing direct content for students. With 30 seconds remaining, he directs the class to draw the parts of an atom. He does not finish the majority of his lesson.

She attempts to call on students throughout the lesson but the engagement does not seem to drive instruction forward or push academic thinking. 

Karen's stated objective is broad and not achievable using a single text in a single lesson.  As a result, Karen did not teach to her objective and the lesson activities were not logical.  In fact, the candidate seems she mislead students teaching that using only one text students are able to describe all the possible purposes for writing;  This misconception also renders her check for understanding null and void.  In fact, the actual activities it will take to accomplish this objective require significantly more time and material than allocated.

She was respectful to all and demonstrates fluent use of English. 
Overall the TSPF was FA-. The candidate chose a lesson objective on identifying specific words and phrases in a historical text that reveal the author's point of view. The candidate did not fully list or describe the key points that she would be teaching. The candidate did not fully outline or detail what students or the teacher would be doing throughout the lesson. The candidate did describe what students would be doing during the activity, but not the questions that would be asked, exemplar answers, or other information. The planned activities are somewhat aligned to the objective. The check for understanding asks that students use evidence from the text to describe the author's view towards women which meets the objective but does not appear to be aligned in the lesson.
TP - FA-. The candidate was visibly nervous or uncomfortable several times during the lesson and mumbled some of her words. The candidate projected her voice loudly enough so that all students could hear her and was formal most of the time. The candidate made eye contact with students most of the time and does not turn her back. The candidate rambles occasionally and her speech was interrupted sometimes by um or uh, especially when answering questions. the candidate lost economy of language for much of the lesson. 
CA - FA-. The candidate's interpretation of the provided objective was mostly correct, but does not address the objective fully. The candidate asked students to identify words that described women and asked for how Chaucer described women, but did not use specific adjectives from the text. The teacher's explanation was unclear and included extraneous content that distracted from the lesson. The candidate conveyed accurate content, but was unclear at times. The candidate did not use clear examples, making the lesson unclear to participants. The candidate's response to a question was unclear to the selector. The question was answered later in the lesson. 
CD - FA. The lesson objective is only somewhat clear to students as it was not explicitly stated or written. The candidate presented information linearly by using examples from students first and then looking at a text. The candidate attempts to check for understanding and assess the objective. The candidate used materials to support mastery of the objective. 
ES - FA.  The candidate purposefully included most participants at least once in the lesson, though it did not drive instruction forward. The candidate gives participants a chance to use words as well as find information from the passage. The candidate addressed all questions, but had a slow response time. 
MIT - FA- The lesson pace is uneven. The candidate finishes the lesson about 30 seconds early and refers to notes often to remember steps. The candidate missed a key component of th lesson when the lesson was stopped. 
GA - FA+. The candidate did not participate during the WTD lesson activity. The candidate's first revised direction was sequential. The candidate incorporated different aspects of WTD during her revision (specific, observable, and sequential). The candidate provided feedback for her group members that helped them improve their directions. 
RT - FA. The candidate accurately incorporates WTD instructions during their reteach at one point, though it is slightly imperfect. She gave a direction that was sequential, specific, and observable. At a different point, she gave very unclear directions. The first directions led students towards completing an academic task. Therefore the candidate incorporates WTD in one part of the lesson, but misses other parts where WTD should have been delivered. During her reteach, she was visibly nervous and began laughing frequently. ",,"double major: english/anthropology; conferred 8/2009

Timothy was FA+ for TS overall.  He was E for CA; he correctly interpreted the objective and all of his content was accurate.  His materials and examples were in support of mastery.  Timothy was FA for CD; he stated his objective and had really materials that helped to demonstrate and teach the objective, but he only attempted to CFA and did not fully complete his CFA.  He was FA+ for ES; all students moved and rotated the triangle/materials and placed on the grid, four of the seven students verbally participated, thus some S had more than one way and some/most S participated once.  He was FA for time; steady but had rushed ending.  

Timothy was FA- for GACT; he did not finish writing his revised direction in either section of the GA and did not provide feedback to his partners - he only pushed back on and questioned the feedback that the other group members gave.  I struggled to give him coaching because when I hadn't fully typed his revised direction and asked him to repeat it, he was unable to repeat it bc it was not written out.  That said, he still struggled with the coaching I eventually gave him.

The candidate was very clear with communication throughout selection day and was professional, polite, and responsive to selectors and other candidates. The candidate is overall Select-Out because he did not spike. 
Overall the TSPF was NFA. The candidate planned a lesson on conjugating Spanish verbs in the present tense and included a model of AR, ER, and IR verbs, pronouns, and conjugations in the present tense in the TSPF. The candidate logically and appropriately completed the planning form. The planned activities are logically aligned to the objective. The candidate planned to provide verbs for students to practice conjugating. The candidate used a CFU at the end of the lesson to have students formulate sentences using conjugated verbs which partially aligns to the objective. Student and teacher actions are outlined, but not detailed.
TP - FA. The candidate is confident and calm for the majority of the lesson, but his interactions were not necessarily engaging. The candidate projected his voice loud enough so that all could hear and his tone was formal. The candidate's body language is informal by not facing the class for more than 15 seconds at a time (during the first AR conjugation). The candidate made eye contact with students the rest of the time. The candidate speaks succinctly and did not lose economy of language when answering questions. 
CA - FA+. The candidate's interpretation of the provided objective is correct and the lesson addresses the full objective. The candidate uses 3 verbs as examples and has students practice reading the verbs as practice. The candidate's response to the questions conveyed and clarified accurate content as well as helped students understand the stated objective. The candidate prioritized content that is the most important for mastery of the objective. 
CD - FA+. The lesson objective was clearly stated verbally and written on the board and the candidate uses a model to clearly communicate the information. The candidate used a CFU to ask the students to apply a skill by practicing saying the conjugations. This activity addressed the objective in part, but did not ask students to conjugate new verbs.
ES - FA. The candidate purposefully engaged students at least once during the lesson by asking questions and having students perform a turn and talk. The candidate gives participants only verbal opportunities to participate in the lesson. The candidate addressed all questions when they arise.
MIT - FA. The lesson pace was generally steady, but was misallocated and slow during the model. The candidate was not able to get to all parts of the planned lesson due to a rushed finish and slow model. The candidate spent the majority of the time on activities to help advance student understanding. 
GA - FA. The candidate stayed on topic and played the correct roles for the activity. The candidate's initial proposed directions were specific and sequential. The candidate only gave positive feedback to other candidates. The candidate incorporated feedback, but without complete accuracy. 
RT - FA. The candidate incorporates WTD during the reteach, but is slightly imperfect. The candidate makes directions sequential, but not specific, concrete, or observable.

Sean's TS presented very weak evidence. Sean appeared confident, though he was not engaging and lost eye contact for significant periods while writing on the board (TP - FA). While his content was largely accurate, he did not fully address the objective as there was no classification of rocks and the only property discussed was method of formation (CA - FA). Sean lecture for his entire lesson and there was no opportunity to CFU (ES - NFA, CD - FA-). He omitted activities from his TSPF (MIT - FA-).

Sean met the bar in CTO (FA). Sean's TSPF shows weak CT. He selects an approved objective (classifying rocks) and most activities are aligned to this. However, he does not teach the objective in full, as students are not directed to classify rocks and only learn about how each type is formed. Teacher actions are indicated, but it's unclear how students are participating at points. During the GA, Sean's initial directions only included some concrete components. His feedback to partners was somewhat vague. He was able to implement my feedback to be more sequential, but without complete accuracy.

For a grade range of 6-12.  The TSPF is completed logically and appropriately.  The two key points listed are clearly aligned to the objective and there are teacher and student actions listed, but they are not very detailed and are not consistent throughout the entire TSPF. There is a check for understanding, however it isn't clearly aligned to the listed objective. Yadira began the lesson with confidence but lacked variations in her tone in order to be engaging.  Yadira lectured for the entire lesson with very little opportunities for student engagement, interaction or participation.  Throughout the lesson, she asked two questions that two different students volunteered answers for. Students were given a handout that listed the parts of the respiratory system but didn’t list the functions.  It was not clear how students should use the worksheet as they weren't given any directions on how to complete the sheet or how to utilize it. Yadira does explicitly state the objective to students, however the model or worksheet provided to help convey the objective and understanding was not used at all.  Yadira concludes the lesson with a question that was an attempt to check for understanding, but the question had nothing to do with the chosen objective or the content covered.  Yadira asked students at the beginning of the lesson to try to keep track of how many times they breathed throughout the lesson.  At the end she revisited this question and in an attempt to check for understanding, by asking students, ""How many times did you breathe during the lesson.""  Therefore it was unclear is students mastered or understood the objective.  There were no clear lesson activities aside from having students attempt to keep track and count how many times they breathed during the lesson.  Otherwise, Yadira simply went through the parts of the respiratory system, explaining the function of each part as she went along.  When asked a selector question, she responded using economy of language. In the group, Yadira remained on task and focused.  She gave feedback to her group members utilizing the feedback cheat sheet.  At one point she even suggested a way for one of her group members to make their WTD better by giving a specific example of what to say. Her initial planned direction only incorporated two components of WTD, but after receiving feedback from her group members and selector feedback, her directions incorporated three of the components accurately.  Overall, Yadira demonstrated some strength when it came to giving and receiving feedback. During the reteach, Yadira gave directions, but they were not WTD.  She directed, ""I'd like everyone to look at the handout, you guys can follow along and trace the pathway as we talk about each part.  If you want to take a note and write these things down."" She continued to lecture and did not attempt to provide students with another WTD. Yadira demonstrated some strength during the group activity, but demonstrated weaknesses in crucial areas such as content delivery and engages students, because of this; it is recommended that she be a select-out candidate.",,"prefers English but no degree

He struggled to give most of partner’s feedback that improved their directions, but for one person he went through each skill and discussed what they had for each one, but this was related to the glow.

Her lesson was weakest in CA and ES. In CA, her lesson did not address the full obj (""Students will be able to distinguish between fact and opinion in an informational text"") because the lesson focused on identifying individual statements as facts or opinions, rather than in an informational text. Even more troubling was the repeated, significant errors in her explanation and examples of facts and opinions. She asked S whether ""Eggs are a good source of protein"" was a fact or opinion. A S said that it was a fact. Then she said, ""But are they the only source of protein? Are they the best source of protein?"" which confused them and also does not seem to clarify the statement as a fact. On her worksheet, she had an example statement: ""The only bird that lives in NYC are pigeons."" A S reluctantly said that it was a fact. She said it was an opinion because she has seen other birds. Obviously, the statement is neither a fact nor an opinion -- it is an incorrect statement. The repeated errors, confusing statements, and incomplete alignment to the obj lead me to rate her NFA in TSO. Her lesson was also weak in ES -- some S answered Qs aloud, but otherwise, there were no other ways to engage S and not all S participated. In CD, her lesson obj was clear, and she attempted a CFU that was not aligned with obj, and she presented info in a highly confusing way, so she was FA-. Thus, her lesson was NFA.

During the GA, she drafted WTD directions that were wordy and confusing, attempting some elements of specific and concrete, but not successfully. She was open to fdbk and offered good suggestions to others, but was not successful at improving her directions through fdbk. Thus, she was FA in GA CT. During the TSR, she attempted WTD 1x, and her direction included some specific and obs components. Thus, she was FA in TSR CT and FA in CTO.

I also had some concerns about EPT. In the middle of another candidate's lesson, she shouted, ""Oh my god! You are blowing my mind right now! Blowing my mind! Oh my god!"" She repeated that several times. She also laughed her way throughout the TS.

She was confident, and projected her voice at a loud enough voice in a formal tone, but she did not use economy of language to describe what metaphors are. She also spent the first minute with her back towards the class, writing the definition of metaphor on the board. In CA, Jennifer earned an FA-. Her interpretation of the objective was mostly incorrect, as she had students find metaphors in Langston Hughes' poem ""Dreams"" and evaluate the purpose behind each metaphor. Only at one point, during the opening, does she discuss literal language-- explaining that literal language is language that is ""matter of fact,"" which was a confusing explanation. She uses an example of ""pearls of wisdom,"" and has students focus on the ""small, specific thing"" that is in the phrase to identify the metaphor. In CD, Jennifer earned an FA-. The objective is not clear to students, as she doesn't talk about the difference between literal and metaphor language, and references that ""we've been talking about figurative language so today we're going to talk about metaphors."" She presents information linearly and uses a model of ""pearls of wisdom."" Her checks for understanding do not assess the objective, they simply ask students to identify the purpose of certain metaphors in the poem. In ES, Jennifer earned an FA+. She asked questions such as ""What is the author trying to say when he says ""Life is a broken-winged bird,"" pushing instruction forward and academic thinking. She only asks questions verbally, but does address all questions from class as they arise . In MIT, Jennifer earned a FA+. Her lesson is steady and she uses the entire time, but wastes time in the first minute writing out a long definition of metaphor. She does not get through her entire lesson as indicated on her TSPF. 

In CT, Jennifer earned an FA. In the GA, Jennifer earned an FA+.

The grade band is 3rd-5th grade.  The TSPF is completed somewhat appropriately and logically.  There are several key points outlined but they are not clearly aligned to the objective. It appears as though Christopher chose the wrong objective from the drop down menu, as the rest of the TSPF is aligned to the key points.  Teacher and student actions are scripted in detail. There is a check for understanding that is also aligned with the chosen objective. As the teacher will be asking students a series of questions to determine their level of understanding. Christopher had very strong teacher presence.  He began the lesson confidently and remained that way throughout the entire lesson.  He used a variety of tones to engage students at the targeted grade level.  When asked a selector question, he appropriately utilized economy of language and answered the question in a way to further student understanding.   However, as far as content alignment, the chosen objective was completely misaligned with the content presented.  When the list of available objectives were checked, it appears that the candidate misunderstood the chosen objective and presented totally different content. Although he spent the majority of the lesson teaching the most important content for mastery, the objective and content were completely misaligned. Christopher began the lesson by stating the objective that was not the chosen objective, but the objective aligned to the actual content in the beginning of the lesson, so it was clear to students. Christopher utilized a model written on the board to help students understand how to structure a question and response about the weather, so that students can understand exactly how to formulate the question and response. Towards the end of the lesson, Christopher used a check for understanding that required students to turn and talk to a partner and practice structuring a question about the weather and a response to that question. Christopher engaged each student at least once, in purposeful ways.  He took volunteers for questions and had students copy the model from the board on to their papers.  He also had students engage in a turn in talk as a way for students to practice and to determine level of student mastery.  Christopher's lesson had a steady pace and was not rushed. He began to check for understanding with about one minute remaining and began to summarize with 15 seconds remaining. During the group activity, Christopher was focused and stayed on task.  He clearly demonstrated that he understood WTD during the planning for practice portion of the group activity.  He struggled slightly when it came to giving a grow from the feedback cheat sheet, but excelled when giving glows.  The feedback given was logical and made sense.  Since Christopher's WTD incorporated all components of WTD, when it was time to give selector feedback, it was suggested he use economy of language and he did so without problem. During the reteach, Christopher demonstrated his understanding of WTD.  He gave clear WTD for students to complete their turn and talk activity.  He directed, ""We are going to practice with each other.  Name off A, B, A, B. We are going to take 30 seconds for A to ask how is the weather and B will respond using one of the adjectives on the board. When you are done, give me a thumbs up. Now we will switch it up. B will ask, and A will reply, when you are done give a thumbs up."" Although these directions could be a slightly more concrete by specifying a noise level, he incorporates all components and gives WTD that moves students towards the completion of an academic task. As a result, Christopher received two overall NFA ratings, which makes him select-out, however he demonstrated many strengths. It does also appear that the NFA ratings are a result of misunderstanding.  Based on the rubric, it is recommended that Christopher be select-out, however, this decision be reviewed.","Christopher did not use an objective on the list of provided objectives.

The directions are clear, but it does not move students toward moving an academic task, it is just to get them writing. Based on not meeting the model of the NYCTF rubric, Jackie would not be accepted into the program.",,"BA in Mathematics conferred 01/2015

Overall, Nora is a weak candidate in all areas of the model. Her TSPF was not detailed. She stated her objective to determine author's purpose is to persuade, inform, or entertain. However, she did not provide any detailed notes of what would be said or done with the students. The lesson plan reads that teacher will introduce anchor chart and read reference material and that students will ask questions. Then in the mini-lesson the teacher will review the anchor chart again. Logical activitiy includes PIE sorting mat with passages. No check for understanding questions, however, candidate states that the PIE matching will be collected for assessment. This, however, matched her TS. Throughout her TS, she read solely from the chart that she had made and read word for word from the chart what each definition was. After reading the chart, she moves into her activity. Her activity was a strength, where she had a kinesthetic PIE sorting activity with paragraphs to match and for students to sort. However, during the activity, she read each paragraph aloud to the students, limiting her engagement with the students, earning her a FA. She attempts to assess understanding by giving students the answers at the end of the activity, but does not have the students answer any questions or demonstrate any skill of learning or mastering the objective. Nora demonstrated poor CT skills in the GA and the TS Re-teach. She needed clarifying questions during the GA stating that it was a lot of directions at one time. She attempted to give her WTD directions, without giving feedback and needed to be reminded to provide feedback first. During the initial planning of her WTD, she needed to be reminded it was an individual activity. Her WTD directions became increasingly unclear throughout the GA. In the TS-Reteach, she showed that she was confused between observable and concrete directions used in the form of WTD to complete an academic task. Instead, she used observables to see if students demonstrated understanding of the material. Overall, Nora did not meet the model for acceptance into the program. ",,,3.5,

In terms of CT she was rated NFA due to an NFA in TSPF and the reteach.

First, in terms of CT she was rated NFA in her TSPF.  Her stated learning objective on the TSPF was, students will be able to determine the main idea and supporting details of an informational text.  But her key points did not address that objective.  For example her key points were, Students will understand what is global warming. They will learn what causes global warming and what are fossil fuels. They will also learn how to solve global warming problem.  Hence her key points were incorrect.  Her planned activity did not reference the objective at all.  Overall she did not convey information in a clear and logical manner.  

Second, in terms of the reteach she was rated NFA.  This was due to a reteach that had no evidence of incorporating WTD directions.  Overall she had the students read from the handout and asked them to underline the most important part and then she called on students to share what they underlined.  There were no WTD added to her reteach and she followed the same plan as her TS. 

In terms of TS she was rated NFA due to NFA in CA, FA- in CD, ES, and MIT.

In terms of CA she was rated NFA.  First her interpretation of the objective was incorrect.  For example, her objective was main idea but she did not teach that skill.  Instead she delivered a lecture on global warming and asked students questions about the text.  Thus her objective and content were completely misaligned.  Also, she spent most of the time reading off her handout which was not relevant for mastery.  Finally, her response to my questions did not answer my question.  For example I asked her to explain global warming again and she read the first paragraph from her handout which did not address my question.  

In terms of CD she was rated FA-.  First she spoke about/read the content from her handout but did  not model it.  Second she did not check for understanding until the end and her check of having students name fossil fuels did not address the objective of main idea and supporting details.  Finally, the objective of main idea was not clear to the students.

In terms of ES she was rated FA-.  This was due to the minimal interaction she had with the students.  For example she lectured for more than half of the lesson.  Also, students were only provided with one way to participate which was answering her questions about the text.

In terms of MIT she was rated FA- due to a lesson pace that was uneven, most of the time spent on her reading off her handout.

Overall Farjana does not meet the bar for acceptance and is selected out.

She asked a clarifying question about the feedback that was given to her, but struggled to then incorporate that into her revised WTD directions. Her TS-Reteach was an FA.  She misunderstands the entire use of WTD, but tries to incorporate some of them into her lesson in her re-teach sample. Marisol particularly struggles with her TS, earning a FA- overall. Marisol earned a FA= in CD and a FA- in MIT. She appears nervous throughout her lesson and uses her notes to guide her somewhat.  She does not provide a clear model for her teaching. She verbally identifies the 5 stages through lecturing from her notes. Exposiiton, the characters and settings revealed. When she responds to the question asked, she misunderstands and states the climax of the story instead of addressing what a climax of a story means. At two minutes left, she tells the students to complete the activity, misallocating the time for activities. There is no closure to her lesson, instead the time just runs out.

She did not specify what students should be doing during the lesson, as the lesson plan was very vague and lacking in detail. She did not list any of the questions she would ask students in her plan. The plan for student practice was very vague and did not actually specify what the students would be doing. During her teaching sample she was confident and spoke at an appropriate tone and volume. She did not have strong economy of language, but she did stay consistently facing the class. She interpreted the objective correctly in that she had students find main idea, but she used a memoir text rather than an informational text. Therefore her lesson materials (reading aloud from a Stephen King memoir was not in service to the objective. The lesson objective was explicitly stated at the beginning of the lesson. She presented information lineraly. Her questions about finding the main idea were somewhat confusing. She asked students to find the main idea of a text but not of a nonfiction one. She engaged students by calling on student volunteers to answer questions out loud. The lesson pace was generally steady, and she did often refer to her lesson notes.  During the group activity she stayed on task and was able to give positive and actionable feedback to her group members. Her WTD directions were concrete, specific and observable, and she was able to implement my feedback. During the reteach she did incorporate WTD directions but they were somewhat ""removed"" from her teaching sample (she referenced students looking at a text they did not actually have in front of them). She finished one minute early and there were missed opportunities for multiple WTD directions. Overall, based on her low score for her teaching sample, I would not recommend Tiffany for the NYCTF program. Her teaching sample was confusing and not aligned to the objective.

Loretta read the intended objective aloud but taught an entirely different lesson about nouns, verbs, and adjectives, with the tenuous connection that these types of words may be part of details.
