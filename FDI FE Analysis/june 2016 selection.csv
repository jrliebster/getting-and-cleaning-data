I have worked full-time over the past few years, an experience that I believe has enhanced my preparation for and excitement towards teaching. For the past 18 months, I have been working in fundraising at a private school in Brooklyn, Berkeley Carroll, under the leadership of a Head of School whose educational visions have inspired me to pursue a career in teaching. While the experience of working in a private school will undoubtedly be radically different than that of teaching in a low-income public school, Berkeley Carroll's philosophy of creating a nurturing and challenging educational environment is one I can take with me anywhere. Additionally, I believe my two-plus years of living in New York have greatly increased my preparation for this program and will enhance my ability to be successful. I feel a familiarity with New York, its various populations and communities, and the challenges that I will face as a teacher here that I simply could not have garnered without living here for an extended period.

The program recognize the education gap and believes all students deserve a quality education, regardless of their financial background.  Most importantly, the program hires people who truly want to teach.  Part of the key to a great education is having teachers who care about their job and enjoy it; a teacher's attitude can influence the student's willingness to learn.  I believe I am a stronger candidate now because I am more mentally and emotionally prepared to be a teacher.  A teacher's educational background is important, but so is their mental readiness.  I know I will have students that may disengage in the class and feel like the class is unimportant, but that can not let it deter me from educating young minds.

I believe I am a much stronger candidate because of my experience serving in many capacities at multiple non-profit organizations in low-income communities across New York City. I feel that this is the work I am meant to do. Every day I look forward to being in front of my kids and stewarding their growth academically, emotionally and overall as a future professional. I have learned that behavior management is one of the hardest aspects of being an educator. This skill only gets better with intentional practice and coaching from an experienced, professional mentor. I eagerly want to be a part of the New York City Teaching Fellow network, where I will not only get to continue to do the best job in the world, but I will be supported by a network of teachers, enrolled in a strong graduate program, and individually coached to perfect my craft. I am applying again three years later, because I have a deeper understanding of the profession, and over the years, I've developed professionally with a growth mindset. Ultimately, my decision to apply again is a true testament to my perseverance in the field. I am ready to shape the next generation of young minds.
",5/15/2013,no,,,,,,no,Accept,Accept,English as a Second Language,3/19/1991,1/20/2016,Highly Recommend,0,Rescind Recommendation,"""Recently I penned a letter of recommendation for Tatiana Reeves in her pursuit of various teaching positions, including a position with NYC Teaching Fellows. As her supervisor I was happy to offer my support for her candidacy and proud when I was told she had been accepted.  It is with regret that I must withdraw my recommendation in the strongest terms and inform you of the recent circumstances that gave rise to this difficult decision.

Tatiana has been a member of my staff at Citizen Schools for the 2015-2016 school year.  She was recently admitted to the Hawai'i corps and, as a native Hawaiian, plans to return to teach there this year.  As a educator, I believe it would be an egregious mistake to allow her to continue to work as a teacher. This opinion is shared by my deputy director and managing director or program, who have cosigned this letter.

Although Tatiana does exhibit some positive qualities, including strong organizational and logistical planning, her lack of professionalism and insubordination has reached such an extreme that I feel compelled to write and inform you of her behavior. 

On Wednesday, May 18th, Tati came in 50 minutes late. It was clear that she was frustrated, and as has become typical, she proceeded to express her frustration in a deeply appropriate fashion.  She proceeded to take items in the office and throw and slam them on the floor.  When asked to stop, she rudely and dismissively insisted she was just moving things, she was then asked to be calm and interact professionally, she responded, you cant talk to me like that.  She was asked to leave for the day to collect herself, to which she responded, if I leave I am not coming back.  

While quitting less than 30 minutes before she was due to teach a class in such a grossly insubordinate fashion would have been disruptive enough to call into question her ability to conduct herself as a professional, she proceeded to attend her class and inform her students that she was leaving, effective immediately, due to a conflict with her assistant director.  This was extremely traumatic for the students, and required a great deal of administrative triage, including a session with the social worker. And yet, Ms. Reeves did not stop there. She proceeded to find the Principal and Assistant Principal and plead her case to them, laying out all the deficits she detected in our program. 

While this incident was isolated in its intensity, it was neither surprising nor an uncommon display.  Tati has demonstrated difficulty self-regulating her emotions on multiple occasions.  She often yells at fellow Americorps members and her supervisors (myself and my assistant director).  She frequently arrives late to work, she has missed 50% of her team meetings with our regional staff, and her attitude has been poison to our culture. 

The culture and experience of Teaching Fellows requires humility, resilience, a growth mindset, and stewardship.  As an alumna of the program, I feel confident that Tatiana is not a good fit.  She has shown extreme disrespect, and has damaged the relationship of our organization with our school partners.  She has shown that the workload of teaching 3 hours a day, 4 days a week is too overwhelming for her to handle emotionally or professionally.  It is my professional opinion that the more rigorous demands of NYC Teaching Fellows will preclude her from thriving as a corps member.

Therefore, it is with regret and apologies that I withdraw my recommendation.

Thank you for following up! Given your situation, we can accept your graduate degree transcripts for now; however, upon acceptance into the Fellows program, and upon enrollment into your university, you will need to provide your WES documents. In the meantime, I can take your application off of ""hold"" status.

Please don't hesitate to reach out via the Contact Form if I can help with anything else!

Kindly,
Marie

HelloI have contacted NYCTF earlier about the difficulties in getting my transcripts from South Africa due to the strike and protests that are still going on. I have gotten in contact with a former professor and she is doing here best to try and speed up the process, but there is still no guarantee that I will get them in time. Since I live next to the university where I completed my masters, is it possible to substitute my masters degree instead? I would have a greater chance of getting it within the deadline and giving me more time to secure my transcripts. Also I was wondering what subject area I am being considered for?Kind regards,Andrea Ortiz",None,,,,,,,,,,,,

I applied because I was unsure that I wanted to go to law school, I loved Math, I enjoyed my Math teaching courses, and one my professors suggested it as an option given my wavering motivation for the law. I believe I was even offered a position as a Fellow. While I regret not accepting the position and instead choosing to go to law school, I am much a stronger candidate now. I now have over ten (10) years of work experience, I am more aware of who I am as a person, what my interests and motivations actually are, what I want my future to be, and I have taken the time to commit to being a Math teacher.

I also applied in 2011 and was not offered a position as a Fellow. During that time, I had experienced frustration with my employment and wanted to pursue a career outside of the law. While I knew that I did not want to pursue the law, I was not really ready to commit to being a Math teacher, nor had I taken the time away from the law to really understand why teaching Math was what I was meant to do. I have taken that time now, I've been away from the legal field for over four months, and I am now 100% ready to pursue my interests in Math and teaching. 

It is difficult to change careers, especially when my legal career seemed predetermined to bring me success and happiness. In reality, that career was heavily influenced by my parents instead of my actual interests and motivations. Today, I cannot envision a future that does not involve me teaching.

As I continue my work in jails, foster systems, and under resourced schools, it is no longer enough for me to accept the limitations of my roles as mentor, advocate, and educator, feeling overwhelmed by my inability to address the roots of why so many youth are disengaged and violated. I want to translate my personal observations and theoretical knowledge into sustained relationships, iterative design, and reflective action that reverses the flow of power and knowledge production toward those who are misrepresented and underrepresented. This means supporting individual and communal capacities for critical inquiry and social action; this means building relationships of trust and mutuality; this means, in Lisa Delpits words, learning to be vulnerable enough to allow our world to turn upside down in order to allow the realities of others to edge themselves into our consciousness.  I will not be satisfied with analyzing the experiences of others. My subjective interpretations are insufficient, especially when they feign neutrality. I will collaborate with communities to sharpen our analytical tools, creating new literacies that will be carried forth into new realities. What does this look like in action? What assumptions can I subvert and what alternate realities can I create? Having authored case studies, annotated bibliographies, and achieved the highest academic award in my undergraduate studies, I am still unsatisfied with the answers I have encountered and struggle to translate theory into action. I need a multiplicity of perspectives and experiences to proceed with my studies and work with greater intentionality. Individual and collective freedom is the hard-earned struggle of returning to oneself and each other through the deconstruction of internal and external barriers.

I am deeply concerned and invested and thus accountable for the state of affairs in our society. As John Donne says No man is an island of itself  we are all responsible for each other, for the state of human society, for the state of human progress, of which is fostered significantly in the halls of educational institutions, in the classrooms where educators and students come together to nurture the seed of knowledge, to help students grow in confidence to take it on responsibly and continue to see it grow, that it may lead to the wellbeing and prosperity of all humanity. 
I feel this very tangible sense of agency within myself to take on the responsibility of an educator, helping to impart knowledge to the next generation, to be built upon by generation after generation, beginning for myself with great hope through the opportunity afforded by New York City Teaching Fellows, a program at the forefront in addressing inequities in education, that it may be administered justly to all students no matter their socioeconomic background. It shows how far we have progressed as a society that an organization such as NYCTF has come into being and continues to make great strides in closing the gaps in education between the rich and poor, increasing the level of academic achievement and career possibilities for our youth. 
I reapply again to NYCTF to join other concerned educators in providing a sound education to youth of today so that they may realize their fullest potential no matter their socioeconomic background. And I know that this is possible, and I am committed to the efforts involved because I have been a student myself coming from a low-income background, and through the sheer will not to give up and the immeasurably significant support of educators akin in their commitment to NYCTF in addressing academic excellence and socioeconomic inequities, I was ultimately able to successfully navigate through the course of primary, secondary and higher levels of education, ultimately earning a Bachelors degree, with prospects to attain even higher degrees and contribute productively to society as an educator, giving back to my community by helping every student achieve the full height demanded by human dignity and intelligence.

She shared that she thought she would have the opportunity to teach in 3 content areas but has only been teaching in Math. Since the focus of technique assessment was ELA, which she hasnt been teaching, she thought she could use one that was already written. She didn't realize she was getting graded on her ability to write the lesson plan. She also said that the stretch it questions were her own (how, what, why?) She shared that she was told that she could use a lesson that they already had, but since she had only been teaching math and didn't have an ELA lesson (which was what they were required to use in the Technique Assessment) that she is at a disadvantage. I reiterated that the techniques are based on a teacher's ability to ask good questions and plan lessons and therefore, she could not use an exemplar plan. 
She also mentioned that she thinks expectations are unclear for using phones since she was told fellows cant have phone out but then there is an expectation that you are checking your email/phone with scheduling and are able to respond to emails and quick changes.

I was not accepted in my initial application, and I believe it was due to my being unprepared. That was 2013.
This time I am ready. I have had two full years of experiences since then. Experiences that have lead me to realize my purpose much more now than I did then.

Creativity and passion are the common underlying threads that resonate within all that I do. I am driven by purpose. It took me a few years to understand this  and to be able to accept that this is who I am. I am constantly in search of avenues and ways in which I can be effective and purposeful, and make a difference in this world, in my lifetime. 

 I have realized that I am needed, my potentials are needed. And for this reason, I have chosen to teach specifically in a high-need school in New York City.
The students need me, and I believe within the depths of my heart that I have all the tools necessary to be an effective motivator, leader, and teacher. 

I want to gather all my skills, all my qualifications, all the experiences I have been through, all the disappointments, all the successes, all my capabilities, all my creativity, all my passion, and use them all in the most fulfilling and productive ways. 
I want to affect a positive effect in New York City high-need schools by paying forward all the phenomenal opportunities that have been awarded to me.

I read Teach Like A Champion and participated in many of the events that were designed to prepare the cohort. My father had been ill with cancer for two years until that point, but it was right before the summer training that he became ill enough to require hospice. I withdrew from the NYC Teaching Fellows because I wanted to be able to spend time with him before his inevitable passing, knowing I would be unable to do that had I gone forward with the rigorous summer training. My father passed away on what would have been the first day of school and, although I do not regret putting off admission to this wonderful program because it was time I truly cherish now that he is gone, I am ready to pick up right where I left off if I am accepted once more. Since that time, I have been teaching English, Sociology, and writing composition courses at St. Paul's School of Nursing. This position has helped me to develop confidence in the classroom; I have learned so much about effective teaching strategies (and some that I thought would be effective, but that fell flat. I know what that feels like too and have a couple strategies to recover from it). I have designed lesson plans and taught students from all walks of life and with varying levels of ability and many different strengths. I have practiced how to effectively manage time and how to structure a lesson so that students stay engaged, focused, and collaborative with each other. I have graded exams into the wee hours of the morning. I feel like an initiate in this way, learning what it feels like to be a teacher. It has been a wonderful opportunity for which I am so grateful, but I am much more inclined to devote myself to teaching in the NYC public school system because I believe that public schools represent the ideal that all children deserve a free education of the highest quality. I would very much like to learn how to be a highly effective educator so that kids who might not have been born with the  ""social capital"" can feel good about themselves, do great things, and have greater access to opportunity and social mobility.

For example my art teacher, Mr. Kelley, helped me prepare an art portfolio for my application to Pratt in a matter of 6 months and shared his career journey after his time in college. Or Mr. Roberts, who often shared of his career change from banking to teaching because he wanted to help people move forward. I realized that I had begun to emulate those men who invested in me while I was developing and found it to be a great joy. I also feel that my time as a Paraprofessional in the Department of Education has helped me grow into a better candidate because it has given me first hand experience within a school setting. Ive been able to observe the day-to-day preparation of the teachers while gaining insight about how to address different style of learners and how to modify lessons to meet the needs of each individual.

Most recently, I have been employed by a software company in Long Island. My current career as a Quality Assurance Analyst is exciting, interesting, and challenging. I am constantly learning new facets of the software and financial industries. Considering I needed additional education on some aspects of my career, I was essentially back in school to absorb as much information as possible. While I love my career and company, I still strongly desire to become a teacher and to be given the opportunity and responsibility to help students in low-income communities. Being accepted to NYC Teaching Fellows would allow me to explore and master my abilities in the world of education. I have also been involved with Big Brothers Big Sisters and have continued to learn and grow with my little sister. She unknowingly teaches me about some of the obstacles she faces coming from a single-parent home and a low-income community. When she speaks about teachers and role models she adores, it further bolsters my goal of becoming a teacher. We constantly learn important lessons from one another during the times we spend together. Finally, after university I continued to play field hockey for an international, adult league where I have experienced many different individuals and cultures. As the league is diverse, I have had the opportunity to meet and learn from individuals from the Caribbean, to Europe, to the Middle East. All of these experiences support my aspiration to become a teacher. I advocate for education and I believe, as a teacher, I will be able to support the need for positive role models in the public school system. I desire challenge and I have learned to not fear hardships, but to find creative ways to overcome obstacles. I appreciate diversity and understand all individuals have a different story to tell.

Since then, I completed my first Masters Degree in African Studies from Stanford, added two additional years of work experience to my repertoire, and spent one summer teaching Syrian refugees English in Turkey. My graduate education confirmed my love for learning as a constant form of intellectual engagement, and most importantly as a path towards growth. 

My two additional years of work experience were in a few different settings, including the Abbasi Program of Islamic Studies at Stanford, Gotham City Restaurant near my home, and Change.org office in the Chelsea section of New York City. I reflected every day on how I could've done better, and made it a point to never stop learning in all settings. 

Lastly, my time teaching in Turkey changed my life. My students were Syrian refugees, and they taught me more about the world and life than I taught them. Classrooms are not just about the material, but how it is transmitted, and how and why students believe the material is of value or not. Education is not effectively delivered without a strong understanding of the context of students' lives. Luckily, I befriended my students as a mentor, and gained their trust. That trust allowed them to channel their motivation toward learning English each and every single day. 

Altogether, these experiences have changed who I am as a person and a professional, and I'm reapplying because I want to dedicate my life to education.

I had worked at this organization for a couple of years and felt greatly invested in their well being and thus didn't feel it was right to leave at that moment. Therefore, I did not participate in the final round, and pulled out of the application process. I left the organization four months ago at a time that felt right and more sustainable for everyone. I have been apprenticing on a farm since then. I am very excited to apply again for the fellowship as teaching is a career I know I want to pursue.

As I apply today, I AM a teacher looking to take the next, most important step in my career -- to become a NYC Teaching Fellow as an ESL teacher.

The first time I applied to be a Fellow, I had no classroom experience; I didnt even know how write a lesson plan! As I apply today, I am able to reflect proudly on over three years of being an engaging and effective teacher in the classroom, writing dozens of stellar lesson plans, becoming a certified TEFL instructor, my overseas work teaching English as a Second Language, and my current day-to-day role as an online ESL consultant.

When I reflect on these accomplishments, I would go further than saying I am a stronger candidate since I last applied. I would say that I am a GREAT teacher now! And more than ever,  I am prepared, excited, and ready to use my talents to provide quality ESL instruction to the NYC students who need it most.

Although I really enjoy working with the adult population, I have always loved helping children develop their literacy and English language skills. I have worked with children at Kumon and enjoy the routine that they must adhere to for successful output. I have volunteered at Sanctuary for Families and taught ESL to early-beginner adult learners. This experience was challenging because of the diversity of student skills and lack of formal education. However, it helped me develop my instruction, assessment skills, and classroom management. Moreover, I just started working at a Zoni (English Language Center) where I teach English to international students and adults. This experience has placed in a formal academic environment, where I am learning how to engage with students, teachers and administration.  Since my last application, I have grown as an instructor and as a student. I have established a foundation on how to effectively approach teaching from a variety of methods. In addition, I have learned how to provide appropriate corrective feedback to students in order to ensure successful uptake.  Moreover, I wish to extend my skills to teaching English to children. I am reapplying because my goals include continuing my education to be a better teacher inside of the classroom. I aim to further my education and earn a MSed in Teaching Literacy (B-6 or 5-12) and Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (K-12).

After three years in the business world I understood the type of life that I wanted to pursue, and the type of impact that I wanted to make.  I made the decision to follow my parents' path (both have been teachers for over 25 years), and pursue a career in education.  After completing the application process, I waited for three months to hear back from the program.  Unfortunately, I eventually received the news that I had not been accepted to the fellowship.  As a result, I was forced to pursue other opportunities that were available to me at that time.  However, a month after I received the initial email, I received another email stating that there had been a system error, and I had indeed been accepted into the program.  But in the month between these emails, I had committed to another job.  This was a heartbreaking experience for me.

It was an experience that forced me to rethink the type of career I wanted to pursue. I now realize that I do in fact belong in the classroom.  I am now more motivated than ever to become a teacher.  This experience has made me even more committed to improving the lives of students in low-income communities, and I look forward to doing my part in the future.

I was ready and motivated to embark on the teaching career I had always envisioned for myself, and Fellows had been an integral part of my plan for several years.  The large number of applicants and my desire to teach in a subject that is not high-needs did not discourage me, and it still does not.  In fact, pushing past my disappointment in my rejection makes me feel even more qualified to teach, particularly in the environment that Fellows work in.  Many students in low income/high needs schools have to work constantly to maintain focus and remain vigilant in their educational pursuits.  They will likely face difficult odds and feelings of self doubt.  In situations like these, it would be a blessing to have someone in a leadership role that has also had to bounce back from rejection. 
A huge misstep in my application process last year was waiting until one of the last deadlines to apply.  I learned from that, and this time am aiming for the early admission deadline.  Being able to regroup, assess your mistakes, and charge forward, are lessons that I would be happy to pass on. Fellows has been my goal since my sister participated almost ten years ago, and I still believe it to be a unique entity in the educational world.  I believe I belong in this program, which concerns itself with all aspects of learning and growth, both that of the student and the educator.

Hi Mr. Soponis,

     I hope all is well. My name is Jamecia Forsythe, and I am currently a NYC Teaching Fellow. Recently we were given our university assignments, and I was given St. John's University. Since I have to take care of my father who has prostate cancer (I can provide any necessary medical records/documents regarding his condition if needed), and since I live in Brooklyn, I put in an appeal to my university, requesting that I be put in Brooklyn so that it would be easier for me to take care of my father, while participating in this program. When I got the appeal decision, I was given Relay GSE, but when I saw the class schedule for Relay GSE, I knew instantly that I would have a problem committing to that schedule because there is less flexibility; therefore I contacted a representative from NYCTF and they told me that the only schools that participates my in subject area are Lehman, Relay GSE, and SJU. However, I never knew that those were my only three options because if I did, I would have never put in that appeal because regardless of whatever school I was given, because of the important fact that I could not stay in Brooklyn, and that I would have to venture out regardless. I was never told that Relay GSE, SJU, and Lehman were the only options I had before I put in my appeal, which makes me feel mislead because I never knew my options were limited (because I thought our chances were with all of the schools in the program), and especially because I had no chance of remaining in Brooklyn. Even though the summer coursework has to be in Queens for SJU, I have the opportunity to take the rest of my classes on the Manhattan campus, with the same flexibility; so I would have fought my way through this summer because looking into the long run, this summer is simply a small feat considering the rest of the program; I would have dealt with the commute for the few months because I know that I can take the rest of my courses in Manhattan. SJU would be a better fit because I can schedule classes for one day, and continue to aid with my father. I understand that the university assignments are final, but I feel mislead because I was never able to explore all of my options, and it lead me to make an uneducated decision, that I would have never made if I knew that my options were limited to three schools, as opposed to schools in Brooklyn, let alone, the rest of the schools. I love everything that this program has to offer, and I worked hard to be in it, and I am excited to teach the new generation. I would hate to have to leave the program and have to do the whole process over because of a simple conflict with a school schedule. I am not asking for any leniency for anything within the realm of NYCTF's pre-service training, just a fair chance to have the best fit with the information I was told only after the appeal. Overall, I just would like to know if you can help me so that I can please go back to my original assignment because it SJU allows me more flexibility, and I would be able to still take care of my father and get my work done, and so that I can continue being a fellow of this cohort (27) and eventually become an effective teacher. I know this was a long email, thank you in advance for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you. If you would like, you can contact me through this email address (JameciaForsythe@Gmail.com), or by phone 347.255.8446. 

Thank you

Jamecia,

At this particular point, the DOE will have to make the decision to allow you back in the program. You do understand that for the summer you must take all courses at the Queens campus.

Subject: University Assignment

Hi Mr. Napoli,

My name is Jamecia Forsythe. I was recently admitted to SJU through the NYC Teaching Fellows. However, I put in an appeal hoping that I would be placed in a school in Brooklyn which would help to continue to take care of my father, but I was placed in another school which class schedule would be very hard for me to commit to because I have to take care of my father. I was unaware that within the program, I only had the options of three schools because had I known that, I would have stuck it out with the Queens commute for the summer, and continue in Manhattan for the remainder. I did get in contact with NYCTF representatives, but they say that there is nothing that they can do. I wanted to know if there is still space in your program, so that I can still attend, and if so, would you be able to talk to an NYCTF representative and have me admitted back into SJU because the class scheduling is much more flexible, and I would love to be a part of SJU. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Thank you
Jamecia F.

I want to be an educator, and I want to make a difference in the lives of children the way my teachers made a difference in mine.  I began to volunteer my time and ideas to my son's day care facility so that I could spend more time with children, some of whom have special needs.  Over the past few months, I have learned exponentially more about children and their ability to gain knowledge.   In working with children on a regular basis, I realized that education strongly remains my calling.  The Teaching Fellows program is an innovative, and unique way for someone like me, who is a career changer, to enter a field in which I can really change lives.  The development of children has always been fascinating to me, and this program truly teaches what it means to be an educator.  
I am a stronger candidate this time around because I have devoted so much more time and energy into learning and understanding children, and I truly comprehend what a commitment it is to be a leader in an educational setting.  I have taught young children, with guidance from the lead teacher, how to express themselves using art and music.  I have introduced a ""feelings"" wall that has allowed children to express how they are feeling when it seems that no one is listening.  I have become very attached to these children, and continuously come up with ways to teach them more than I did during our last session.  My commitment to education is even stronger this time around, and I still firmly believe that the Teaching Fellows program is the best path for my goals.

I believe this program will shape and mold me into not just an average teacher, but an extraordinary educator. I appreciate the fact that there is Pre  Service Training because I know I will be receiving the necessary fundamentals to be very successful at teaching.  Also what attracts me to apply again is the subsidized masters degree especially in the day and age of such economic difficulties. 

     Furthermore, I think I am a stronger candidate because I am better prepared than before.  I did a lot of research and really wanted to ensure I was making the right decision on whether or not I want to make teaching my career.  I feel that I understand the role of an educator more confidently, that teaching comes with a lot of challenges that it is not just sitting at a desk; teaching is such a hands on experience and I know I am ready to face every challenge given to me because there will be a story of success from the students that I teach.

Hi Patricia and Principal Demeo,

Thank you for reaching out. Unfortunately, we are unable to change the subject areas of Teaching Fellows. Fellows are selected and assigned specific subject areas because of their previous coursework in the assigned subject area. In addition, unfortunately, business is not a focus subject are for the Teaching Fellows nor for any other alternative certification program. 

Im cc-ing my colleagues on the school staffing support side of the office who are better equipped to assist. 

Best,
Nuree

Dear Patricia:
 
As we discussed earlier today, we have had a devil of a time hiring Business teachers.  However, I have had the good fortune to meet two Teaching Fellows who hold Transitional B licenses in Mathematics.  I wanted to know if we can contact their folks to change the Transitional B licenses from Math to Business.  
 
I have spoke to the candidates noted below and each person has stated that they want to have the licenses changed in order to join our staff.  
 
The candidates are:
 
Eileen M. Kelly
SS#: 085-78-1163
 
Kevin Ross
SS#: 132-70-2825
 
Please let me know if you need additional information and thank you for your assistance.

I hope you enjoyed your holiday weekend! I want to flag for you a potential rejection for Fellow Hirving Henriquez. Our Admissions team has flagged that Hirving has been unable to provide an official, degree-conferred undergraduate transcript that shows proof of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution of higher education. Hirvings transcript conversion is unable to explicitly state that the degree he earned from Universidad Catolica Tecnologica Cibao in the Dominican Republic is equivalent to a U.S. baccalaureate degree. We are still working with the World Education Services to try to get any updates on Hirvings prior educational history, but it appears most likely that we will need to deny him admissions. 

If he is rejected do you know if there is another institution that hed be able to attend? We are very crestfallen at this news from our admissions team as Hirving has shown tremendous potential over summer coursework so far.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks!

VISTA programs are all centrally focused on eliminating poverty in America, an  I believe education is so important to create a more equal future. Though I am thankful for the compulsory education we enjoy in America, there are still many disparities in the quality of education children receive. These disparities are often based on skin color and economic status. . Regardless of these factors, every child should be able to achieve in school, and discover subjects they are passionate about: This is the philosophy that New York Teaching Fellows strives to make a reality, and I'd like to be a part of this effort. I am a stronger candidate this year, because I've gained valuable experience working in low-income communities as a VISTA for Indianapolis Public Schools. I've learned about the many boundaries low-income students face when trying to achieve in school, and have participated in the many practices IPS uses to boost student achievement. In a district where 100 percent of the student population receives subsidized lunch, IPS struggles to raise student achievement. The district is using many methods to combat factors that inhibit student achievement. For instance, Parent Involvement Educators help parents support their children's schooling, and College and Career Readiness Counselors to prepare students for college. Curriculum is focused on skills students can use in their adult lives, while teachers and administrators receive more training on how to engage students in material through alternate teaching methods. I can use many of the teaching methods I've learned working in IPS in my own classroom.

Second, I feel that since first applying, I have increased my scope of teaching and gained considerable experience over the last seven years.  I have refined my methodology as a teacher, and broadened my pedagogical background. My skillset now includes extensive work with educational technology and a wider approach to different learning styles, so that I now have more capacity to reach the diversity of student needs.

I had a phone interview and I made it to the in person interview. It was truly an amazing experience. I know that being a part of  the actual cohort would be a life changing experience. I look forward to the challenge. I could see myself being a part of the city and serving its students!

Of the thousands of applicants that the program gets, I am still surprised that I made it to the last stage. To me, the fact that I applied so late and was still offered an in person interview meant that something was seen in me and I am humbled by the experience. That something is still here and stronger, which is why I am reapplying. I feel that the among the things that might have held me back last year are the subject area that I applied for is highly competitive from my understanding (special education) , and my undergraduate GPA is not strong.  I have started an online Masters program and I currently maintain a 3.0 GPA. I am hoping that this will show that  I am able to work full time, take online classes and maintain a satisfactory grade point average. I anticipate completing this degree May, 2016 with at least a 3.5 GPA. I am also hopeful that applying earlier might help as well. I also have additional work experience working in an environment very similar to a classroom with staff that work as my program assistants. Additionally, I don't give up on the things that I want.

Please contact Teaching Fellows to discuss your situation further.  I have included Ms. Clarke from Teaching Fellows in this email chain. You can only remain in the program and in the University while attending classes and working in the NYC Department of Education.  Please contact me after your discussion.

Subject: Re: Dropped as of December 2016

Hi Ms. Campoverde,
I am truly sorry for any inconvenience that i have caused by not registering for Spring 2017 courses or may cause. It it with a heavy and hopeful heart that i write this email.  I was truly unaware that i was unable to register for Spring classes due to missing transcripts from 3 colleges. I had been under the belief that i had submitted all the necessary transcripts to process my admission. I was only aware that i had 3 deficient credits. When i logged in to register for classes, nothing was available. Foolishly, i assumed that all the classes had filled up and decided to wait for more to open up. I tried again a few weeks later and encountered the same problem. I then called the graduate admissions office and was told i had a hold on account because i was missing transcripts from 3 colleges and i could not register until those transcripts were received. I tried my hardest to get all 3 transcripts in, but i was only successful with Baruch and Hostos Community College. I had difficulty requesting a transcript from San Antonio College due to technical issues they were experiencing. Due to this i was unable to register for Spring 2017 classes. I had no idea it would result in being dropped. I simply assumed i would be able to make up the Spring classes over the summer or graduate a term late. I am not excusing my negligent behavior, i know fully well that i am at fault for my current predicament. I should have followed up with you or an administrator at Pace, but i got buried under the workload of being a first year teacher and slacked. Please, i know i shouldn't ask, but i am pleading, begging and asking for your help. If anything can be done to maintain my Trans B and to keep me as an active student at Pace. The last thing i want on earth, or better yet in this world is to lose this wonderful and amazing opportunity that i have been given and have worked so hard for. I am truly, truly sorry i was negligent in not submitting all the necessary transcripts, in not being more proactive and checking that i was in good standing. I truly do not want to be dropped. I want with every fiber of my being to continue in the graduate program at Pace. Please give me an opportunity, any opportunity if possible to stay in the program. All the transcripts should have been received by Pace by now. Please let me know how to proceed going forward.
I look forward to hearing from you and to your assistance, any assistance that you can provide in helping me resolving being dropped.

Thank you and have a good evening.

Hi,
 
I'm skipping my own team on this one because Carmen has said in the past that teaching fellows would be prioritized for the Bronx.  This school is in the Bronx. Is D75 higher priority? 
 
I'm checking first before I start making my team run around trying to fix this, especially if it's not fixable. 
 
Thanks!

Hi Alex- 
Here is the situation. After looking at hundreds of candidates we offered Augusta Kosia a position teaching Special Education at our school.  We have ICT and Self Contained students.  After accepting our offer, NYCTF said she could not work at our school because she had to work at a D75 school.  I had already entered her into Galaxy as our intended. This is a huge blow because we informed all other candidates in process that the position had been filled.  Please let me know if there is ANYTHING I can do!  Thank yo for your help.

I also know that my former director from Queens Community House was accepted in the program and someone from Harlem RBI was accepted in the program. Lastly a good friend of mine encouraged me to apply again. I feel that since the last time that I applied, I gained more experience with working with children. I worked in a summer camp for Queens Community House as an assistant, then because of my work ethic, punctuality, and the way I worked with the kids I was offered to come back as an assistant again in September of last year. There I worked with elementary school age children from different backgrounds and cultures which influenced how the parents and kids interacted in school or with the teachers, and after school/summer camp programs. I soon left because I was offered a better opportunity to join Harlem RBI as a learning coach apart of AMERICORP. It was a different experience for me because I learned how kids and their families from low income communities affect how they perform in school. Their socioeconmic status plays a big role for the kids, their families and the program. I learned to adjust to each kids needs and learned that I have to stratagiize different ways to deal with the kids disrespectful atttitudes because the way they were in school with me, it is the same way they acted at home, and many of their parents have the same atttitude. My co coach and I had to nagivate and find different ways to communicate to the parents and pull in their interest. I also began working in a day care which was a new experience for me. I decided to broaden my horizens and try working in a day care. It was different for me because I am used to working with kids that know how to speak, use the bathroom themselves, and can do things on their own. Therefore working in the day care was hard but led me to learn to have more patience and understanding. Throughout my experiences working with kids I possessed skills such as identifying child abuse and learned how to identify SIDS and shaken baby syndrome which were new topics to me. My experience working in the restaurant also helped me to learn food saftey practices, I use that when I see food being prepared in the day care. I believe that I am a stronger candidate because I have gained experience, posssess new skills, and learned new traits that will help me when working with children of any age or any socioeconomic  status.

Although I had made it to the group interview stage, I feel like I was flustered when it came to the group interview.  Skipping half of my lesson plan, It was clear that I was very nervous.  Looking back I understand that as an educator one can not get flustered when things go awry. Having confidence, knowing the material, and where you want to go with the material will allow an educator to get back on track.  I understand why I was not selected to proceed further. 
Seeing the positive experience that the Fellowship program is, I hope to leave a more lasting impression this time.

I have always wanted to have a part in peoples betterment. I feel that becoming a part of the education system via the New York City Teaching Fellows would provide me with a perfect opportunity to do so. As a teenager, I felt it was possible to serve this purpose through architecture, but in my experiences since Ive found that the classroom would be my ideal environment to be in. Thank you for your time and consideration.

From the moment of disappointment when I wasn't accepted to the program I knew I would reapply and take the year to make sure I was the best candidate possible. Although I knew I was a strong candidate from my resume, transcript, and prior experience I knew there was something missing, my confidence. I know the program is very demanding. I knew I had the work ethic to take on the work load. I worked full-time since I was a sophomore in high school, and completed my bachelor's degree taking night classes while working full time. Last year when I applied even though I felt better and ready to return to the work force after my accident,  I had not been able to go back to work yet. I knew that to have the confidence I had to know that I could not just meet the demands of the program, but could exceed them and excel. So this past year I've done my best to make sure I could do just that. I've worked hard to make sure I was back to 100%, and both physically and mentally ready for the challenge. I started working to regain my confidence in myself and my abilities. I started looking for a job that would help me prepare for becoming a teaching fellow this year. I was looking for a job with similar hours, and called for interaction with students and parents. 

I found what I was looking for, and started working for Healthy Smiles, a school based dental practice, as a Marketer and Dental Assistant. We go to schools all over NYC and provide dental services to children, mainly in low-income neighborhoods without proper access to dental services. As a Marketer, I go to the schools during student drop-off and dismissal, meet with the parents individually, explain our program services, and obtain a signed consent form for their children to participate. I also often give an in-service seminar for parents and teachers where I explain our program, give information on oral hygiene, offer tips to prevent childhood tooth decay, and answer any questions. Once I have collected the consent forms, I go to the school with the dentist and/or hygienist as a dental assistant. Before the Hygienist starts the cleanings for a class, I give the kids a short lesson on oral health and hygiene, then using a custom prop, I demonstrate proper tooth brushing technique. While assisting the dentist I help to calm down children from crying or refusing to participate, with my help they often willingly participate. Working this year with Healthy Smiles, has assured me I am definitely physically and mentally ready to start the NTCTF program. I know I am able to work the hours required while taking a full course-load. More than that, this job has made me want to become a teacher more than ever before.

I have been in supervising roles which have not fulfilled me professionally or emotionally. I no longer had direct contact with individuals to support their needs and goals. I have learned being a leader outside the realm of offering direct support is not sustaining for me. Teachers are highly motivating, who instill drive and persistence within the classroom. Ms. Cobb, my fourth grade teacher helped me because she went the extra mile to get to know her students and support them past their academic goals. This was very inspiring.
 
Working with youth, has always been the most rewarding for me. As a teen advisor and program coordinator, I was managing programs but knew it was important to maintain an effort to remain involved and support youth with developing workshops, supporting participants write essays or apply for college.  Introducing government to middle school and high school students was astounding as they learned the process of city and state governments along with the powers they held now and in the future. Educating and empowering young people has always been uplifting for me.  I appreciate the significance of being an educator, who is structured and equipped to deliver the best resources in a classroom. Guiding students in a classroom is powerful and I yearn to be that motivating factor for students in New York City.

In a way I'm grateful to have been rejected the first time I applied as it gave me the opportunity to look into other career paths and reevaluate my goals.

In retrospect, I believe I made the right decision in delaying my full application to NYC Teaching Fellows, because my interest in going into education in New York City has only grown, and my service with City Year has made me a stronger candidate as well. I am much more confident in my belief that I am ready to teach in a school in a low-income neighborhood in the city, and I got to test the waters without the onus of responsibility of teaching an entire class being on me. While I firmly believed last year that I would make a great teacher when I applied, I know that even just the year's experience has made me stronger.

Additionally, there wasn't anywhere else in the application I felt appropriate to include it, but I wanted to include it here: I'm qualified to be a candidate for Special Education in Social Studies in all ways EXCEPT I don't have three credit hours of college economics on my transcript, which is why I said I am not qualified based on those metrics (regrettably, because history is my main academic passion, and being a high school history teacher- likely special education as well- is my ultimate career aspiration). However, I did take a combined AP Government/Economics class my senior year of high school (one semester of government and one of economics), and I would be able to provide my grades for that upon request if that would qualify me (I got a 5 on the AP Government test- not the issue given I took a number of political science/diplomatic history courses in college- and my school didn't offer any AP Economics test, or else I would have taken it). Alternatively, I would be more than willing to take a course online, at a community college, or through some other appropriate avenue between now and the start of the 2016-2017 school year if that would qualify me.

When I returned from the hold, the voice on the phone was a different person, and she continued requesting more information. I informed her that I could set up a meeting with a supervisor if she would like, but I could not guarantee that they will be able to provide additional information.

I shared as much as I could and emphasized that there was no specific thing I could point to, as it was a holistic decision. She said another person with her same score was passed and she wanted to understand why. I told her I couldn't speak to that specific person, but it was a holistic decision and there are a number of reasons there might be different decisions for fellows with the same scores. 
",Withdrawal,Attendance ,"David asked to speak to me about her attendance today. 
She came in very late this morning but was able to have her observation (she was 99 mins late). When she checked her attendance she was very upset to see that she had been marked absent on 7/18 as she did come in to PST but was throwing up. While she said she wanted to stay,  David insisted that she leave and he said he couldn't have her there as he didn't want her throwing up in the middle of SBS. 
She was very upset about that when she saw that it counted as an absence and said she would have just stayed on the premises if she had known is counted as an absence.
David is concerned that she will be automatically removed from the program as he made the decision that she had to leave. I explained that that would not be the case and that her two emergency absences are to be used in such instances. 
She is in the Consider Evidence bucket and David said he will recommend that she be kept in the program.

Currently I am working at Horizons Juvenile Detention Center, which NYC considers to be ""the worst kids"" in NYC. This career has been a real eye-opener. I can now understand why I was not accepted the last time I applied. These students can be very challenging, not only to get them to learn but towards you too. I feel once you take the time to really get to know these kids you will see they are no different than any other teenager. They all want to feel wanted and loved and when they are not getting it at home it can turn them elsewhere.  I also believe I am a stronger candidate this time because I can work in any school. I now know what secure and non-secure detention is and how to handle children who are in these facilities. 
    After working in detention I feel that I can do more to make a difference in these children's lives. I love my job and the children but I want to do more.

Unfortunately, it isn't like this and children of low income households are beginning way behind the start line.  More often than not, they are forced to attend the school within their district giving them little to no options.  This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the challenges these schools have themselves such as limited resources & staff.  Because these students often fall behind in basic skills such as reading, they are less inclined to want to pursue the classes within the STEM category.  However this isn't the only problem.  The other issue is that teachers for STEM related subjects are often credentialed in something else.  This isn't to say that those will not make excellent teachers.  However I truly believe that to teach something, one has to be invested in that subject material.  This is what motivated me to reapply.  I have taken a deep investment into studying biology.

I was put on this earth to teach and every day the feeling becomes greater, Teaching has always been a very strong passion of mine; I have always had a concern in securing the future of the young minds.  Even now I am  up to date with all my nieces and nephews report cards  and  have question all of them  as to what they feel they can improve to get  better grades and have a successful academic year. My concern for the academic achievement of children is what fuels me to become the best teacher I can be.   I want to make a commitment to having a positive effect on student achievement, and also make them feel self-confident enough to pursue any career of their choice.  I am a dedicated individual, and I aim to be a strong positive teacher who in which influences her students. An additional motivation for me to reapply was a very influential teacher; Mr. Ovalles was a history teacher  I had in high school, despite the limited resource he had he always enforce us to do better and strive for the best. He took the responsibility of demanding nothing but the best from his students, he broaden our learning experience by using the internet , old articles, and other methods to intrigue us and to help us remember historical facts. Meeting such an individual like that has always helped push me into the direction of wanting to teach. I feel that I am a stronger candidate since the last time I applied because I know the struggle of growing up with limited resources or learning outlets and still striving and doing my best, by being accepted into this program I will be given the opportunity to help other children find their passion regard less of their economic status or cultural background. On a  macro level this will be a way of me giving  back to the low  income communities  , which I s very important to me  , When I first filled this out my nerves got the best of me and did not allow me to convey the feeling of necessity that I have to give back to low income communities.",5/26/2010,yes,,,,,,no,Hold,Hold,Special Education - Bilingual,4/16/1986,2/10/2016,Recommend with Reservations,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After being in health care for a few years, the thought of teaching remained in the forefront of my experience.  Health care has enabled me to be motivated to teach again because I interact with patients from all different backgrounds.  From new mothers to patients recovering from surgery, everyone has a story to tell and it is part of the healing process to reminisce about the different facets of life, which schooling helps to shape and mold.

I also come from humble beginnings in a small rural town.  This has instilled an empathetic outlook on life wherein each individual becomes the benefactor of their own decisions, and I refuse to enter a career field in which salary and isolated achievement are the primary factors of success.  Of all the lessons any student learns throughout their education, making decisions that involves the well-being of others is a true way to measure progress of the individual while increasing the happiness of those around them.

Growing up I knew that I wanted to be doing something that involved children. As I have grown older I have come to regret not pursuing a career in Education. I am the youngest of three children. I have always looked up to my two older sisters. I see them as role models and I have always wanted to follow their footsteps when it came time for me to choose my career path. This resulted in me putting aside what I really had a passion for and decided to pursue the same career as them in Business. However, I have always been the kind of person that believes that it is never too late to follow ones dreams. When I first heard of the NYC Teaching Fellows program I felt so excited. I was very ecstatic to hear that through the program I could finally get the chance to fulfill my lifetime dream while giving back to children who need it most. I first found out about the program close to the deadline of the application submission. But I knew that in order to pursue my dream I had to not give up on the opportunity. I took advantage and proceeded to apply because I did not know if I would have another chance to apply. I didnt want to miss out on the opportunity, so I still went for it. I am conscious that I may have not expressed myself in the manner I would have liked to if I had more time. I believe that ultimately the lack of time was a disadvantage and had a significant impact on the end result. Since then I have had time to continue growing and finding myself experiencing more situations that have further enhanced my desire to teach. I have had time to interact with families and children who are less fortunate and lack in essential resources. This has allowed me to understand more the value of educating these communities. My desire is to be given the chance through your program to gain the skills to teach. However, I know that no matter the final result I have already demonstrated that I stand as an example to what we want to encourage our children to be. We want them to know that even if it takes several attempts. A goal cant ever be accomplished if we dont try with strong persistence and dedication.

It wasnt until I had spent time in all the different classrooms Weston has offered me, working with so many different ages, grades, diagnoses, and backgrounds, that I was sure this was the direction I needed to take.  After a few long talks about a student with the psychologist at our school, I was inspired to take another psychology class at our local community college.  I decided to try and learn sign language after it was being introduced by a speech pathologist in one of our classrooms.  Most importantly, I love watching my fellow teachers at work, and I want to contribute to this great profession.  And while Ive certainly been made to feel like a valuable member of my school, I know there is still so much I can learn to become a more effective teacher.  Whats more, a masters degree would pull me out of the typical one-to-one style case management for a paraprofessional and offer me the opportunity to help more students as a teacher.  Coincidentally, I recently met a graduate of NYCTF, Sarah Gotimer, a friend of a French teacher with whom I used to work, and she had nothing but positive stories to share (including that she still works at her original school after 5 years!).

She asked about the additional evidence we consider, and mentioned her TAD had recommended her - I referred her back to the PST handbook's explanation of which evidence we consider.

Tiffani asked if we received an additional perspective from her CT - I explained that we do not collect that as part of our process.

She indicated she was completely surprised and had no idea that she could be outplaced. I spoke to her about the messaging we give in the Handbook and referred her to that.

Students cannot be held back because they had the misfortune of being born into a low-income community; genius and greatness are not distributed by the wealth of the community and we cannot risk brilliant minds slipping through the cracks. I once read: the grave yard is the richest place on the planet as it contains so many ideas that never came to be and all the dreams that were never realized. We cannot allow this to be because of educational disparities due to income. 

Since my last application I have bettered myself by gaining my Masters in Biology from New York University. This has vastly increased my subject specific knowledge base, I will be able to use this to teach my students beyond just the textbook information and hopefully harness their inquisitive nature. Students who enjoy a subject will often have their imaginations exceed the curriculum, and as a scientist I understand the importance of kindling the sparks of inspiration. If a student has questions on a topic that exceeds what the textbook says, they deserve an educator who can take them to that next level. I now have the educational background to discuss biology to any level the student requires and I have the experience to help them plan any future they may be interested in pursuing.

Additionally, I have become more experienced in research keeping me at the cutting edge of biological advancement; this will allow me to use real world scientific experience to help teach the most contemporary biological concepts. The practical application of concepts is one of the best ways to learn, my extensive research experience has allowed me to take textbook knowledge and apply it to real world situations; it is important for students to understand how what they are learning applies to real life for them to become inspired by the subject. During research it is often a necessity to briefly and clearly explain procedures you are conducting, from this I have been able to develop an ability to use analogies to simplify complex scientific concepts making them easier to use and explain to others. The use of analogies will be a great tool to help combat student anxiety over complex concepts while also being entertaining enough to keep attention and promote student engagement.  

In human history there have been a great many ecological disasters occur, from species extinction, deforestation and the more publicized issues of climate change. To reverse these negative events and protect the planet we live on, scientific understanding must be established at an early age in order to have an impact in adult decision making. As I have stated in a previous answer, the USA is a world super power but has drastically dropped in educational rankings, particularly math and science. How can we possibly make ecological or scientific progresses as a planet if the loudest voice is not the best informed? Through the Teaching Fellows, I will be able to provide the highest standards of scientific education to my students, ensuring that future generations will have a much greater understanding and empathy for conserving the natural world.

I wanted to continue my pursuit of being a teacher because I want to motivate New York City students to achieve academic success in my classroom and in their academic future endeavors. Furthermore, I want to inspire students to attain academic success in my classroom and in their future in order for them to get a degree and be able to offer their children a bright future. Another reason I reapplied to the NYC Teaching Fellows is because I want to provide a promising future for my mother and my future children while at the same time making a difference in the lives of NYC students. I, as a teacher with a stable job, can be able to assist my mother with her medical bills and rent and offer my children a safe living environment. I have become a stronger candidate since I last applied because I gained more experience and knowledge working with NYC children since graduating college. When working in Oasis Summer Day Camp and in the Washington Heights Academy afterschool program, I learned that analyzing is a huge factor in the students overall well-being and academic success. When teachers analyze the students in the classroom, they are aware of the students behavior and the childs performance in class through participation and grade scores.

Needless to say, that I was neither sensitive nor informed about the caliber of patience, sincerity, and commitment that it requires in order to make a difference in the lives of many children living in urban NYC communities. Today, after spending over a decade teaching, mentoring, and volunteering in the non-profit sector, I recognize that I could have a more serious impact on the educations students enrolled in New York City Public Schools if I were better educated and qualified to teach them. It is clear to me now, that I will be most effective at my cause to change lives through education if I am properly trained and educated as a certified teacher. For this reason, I am invested in becoming a team player with the New York City Public School System. 

In addition, based upon my experience as a TSAC instructor at Rikers Island Prison in New York City (under the NYC Mission Society umbrella), I feel that I can somehow I may be able to save more kids from being housed in a jail cell. The alarming statistics of Latino and African American boys and girls being incarcerated  in the juvenile justice system is staggering. I am baffled by the number of students who find themselves locked up, in lieu of attending an institution of higher learning or greater development program.  Thus, I feel that if I were able to teach in NYC Public Schools, I can save many children from this path of mass incarceration, social injustice, and inequality.

I became a high school math teacher in Panama, where I teach the SAT exam, Algebra II and AP Calculus to ESL students. In these teaching roles, I continuously expand my mathematics and pedagogical skills. 

Concomitantly, I developed a growing appreciation for formal pedagogical training, which is indispensable for professional teachers. I frequently turn to my experienced colleagues for advice on various topics such as grading, classroom management, and organized writing on the dry erase board. I find that I often miss some teaching tricks, which I currently pick up through trial and error. Formal pedagogical training will minimize my teaching weaknesses and enable me to expertly teach all levels of high school math. 

The New York City Teaching Fellows program and Math Immersion Program will serve as the perfect platform to become a professional in the field of education, and mathematics in particular. I hope that this year New York City Teaching Fellows program will recognize my determination to become a fellow and see me a suitable candidate.

I have continued to educate myself independently through online non-credit coursework and volunteering opportunities. Each course I take, and each person at work whom I am able to help learn English, apply for citizenship, or whose child I tutor, makes me a better person and instills in me a further passion for pursuing teaching as a lifelong career. In the past few years, this goal has helped shape my attitudes at work and in my personal relations with people. I work with some people on the racetrack who have seemingly severe interpersonal conflicts, and can be tough-talking and at times downright abusive. I have tried over the past years to understand these coworkers better and develop a non-judgemental work relationship; I think at all times that, if I were teaching, it would be inappropriate to say anything that would escalate conflict or be in any way counterproductive to a positive work environment.
My volunteer position at my local library has been extremely educational for me. I see where my shortcomings lie, and have been able to adjust to a class setting in which I am the moderator. I love preparing lessons, inviting input from my students, and drawing on students' individual strengths and backgrounds to help them feel like an integral part of the group. 
I am currently taking courses through Edx and Coursera, both in English and in Spanish, which help me not only learn, but to manage my time. Since I am working full-time and have volunteer and personal tutoring obligations, I make an effort to keep on top of my own studies to facilitate the transition when I am in a full-time Master's program.

I became aware of the program upon the suggestion of a high school principal that I had done some design work for. Since teaching was my first love, and I was getting ready to graduate from college with a degree in Communication Design, I felt like it was fate since I was not satisfied with the idea of using my skills solely for conspicuous consumption. I wanted to use my passion and training for a greater purpose.

I made it to the group interview phase of the process. However, as the appointment drew near, an unfamiliar sense of anxiety began to overwhelm me. I began to question my motives. ""Why are you really doing this?"" The response was the same, ""because you said you always wanted to."" I got closer and closer to the interview date, that answer felt inadequate. One the day of the group session, I began to feel like an impostor. The passion for teaching was still in my heart but I had not taken into account how much I had changed as a person over the course of my adulthood. I did not want to be a glorified babysitter that mimicked lesson plans and prepared students for standardized tests that mean absolutely nothing in the real world. I needed to reevaluate my mission.

Over the course of the next few months I began to simplify my life in radical ways, getting rid of all preconceived notions of who I was, stripping myself of the psychological defense mechanisms I had created in order to survive over the past decade. It was an excruciating but liberating process. I reemerged with a stronger sense of purpose. 

I realized that I do not just want to be a teacher, I want to change the way young inner-city students perceive education. I want to help children become masters of their fate, using knowledge as a tool to solve the problems that have plagued their communities for generations. I want my classroom to be a laboratory, where the students are the scientists and the curriculum is the experiment.

Hi Felicia,

Thank you for forwarding Principal Zigelmans message along. Based on her message heres what Im seeing as key points; please let me know if Ive captured them well enough to have a clear understanding of this Fellows situation:

 1st year Fellow, Oriannies Reyes, has not reported to work the last 13 days, because of a medical situation
 She plans to report to school once she received medical clearance but has not yet provided medical documentation
 She previously resigned but was convinced by the principal to rescind the resignation. 

Ok some follow up questions:
1. Re: Medical documentation  is there any documentation the Fellow has provided that stated that she needed to take time off? Given that shes a new employee, she wouldnt qualify for FMLA; has there been any understanding or agreement between the Fellow and principal that the Fellow would need to take some time off for medical reasons? 
2. When did she submit the resignation letter that she was convinced to rescind? 
3. Has the principal hired a per diem teacher to fill in for the Fellow the last 13 days? 

A few things to remember:
 Shes currently appointed now, but her certification status with the statewell, shes not certified. So if we do terminate her, her staffing status would need to be updated to 5BA, and then be given her 10-days notice of termination. 
 The other road we can take is to have Fellow re-submit a letter of resignation, but that would mean she is resigning from the Fellows program. If shes terminated, she has this month to search and secure another position by early January, and thus remain in the Fellows program. 

Best,
Nuree

Hi Nuree, 

If I am correct, we can terminate her service as she is a sub assigned. Please let me know if this is correct for a teaching fellow and if we are indicating a dqt. 

Thanks.

Good Morning, 

The above staff member now has 13 days out.  She is a NYC Teaching Fellow, first year who has not passed her state exams.  Since she has informed us she is out until she receives medical clearance, MS 322 wishes to now terminate her employment.  Note, to date she has provided no medical documentation.

Previously, she had resigned which I convinced her to rescind.  Unfortunately, she is having major issues in her personal life which is not allowing her to perform her duties at work. Her observations to date have not even been developing.  Students are not being serviced.  

Please tell me what steps we must take to complete the termination.

One of the ways I felt extremely unprepared to teach last fall was in the area of lesson planning. Yes, Fellows provided me with a general guideline of how to do it with general principles of what makes a good lesson. 

BUT. As an ENL teacher, I wish I would have started to incorporate Language Objectives into my lesson plans earlier. I didn't even learn about Language Objectives until an ENL colleague mentioned it at my school. If NYC DOE is going to be serious about meeting the needs of diverse learners, then we need to start addressing the needs of ELLs in a widespread, comprehensive way. What better place to start than Fellows? 

This should be the shared responsibility of Fellows AND University programs because this issue is extremely important. If Fellows is unable to incorporate Language Objectives into their current curriculum, then at least direct TADs, Coaches, and Instructional Leads to instruct the ENL teachers at their summer training site to start incorporating Language Objectives into their summer lesson plans.

""Good day,
I hope this email finds you well.  
On May 5, 2017 at 2:05pm a student stabbed and cut me with a scissor on my little finger of my left hand.  I went to the hospital.  I am traumatized and have a high level of anxiety.  I NEED HELP.  I cannot go back into that classroom.  The student's are traumatized, the paraprofessionals are traumatized and I am traumatized,  

This is an 8:1:1 class, 2-3 grades,  with four paraprofessionals in the room all standardized students. My AP has been using the Danielson framework as a punitive instrument to give me poor ratings.   I was not provided the curriculum for third grade testing students and I have four testing students.  I was given 1st and 2nd grade Go Math curriculum and one week before the spring break was given third grade Go Math workbooks.  I was told to create my own ELA curriculum, but was not provided with the third grade ELA curriculum work books, but was told to use Engage NY online, which I did.  I was not given any curriculum mapping for ELA or Math. And these children's state test scores are used for my MOSL ratings as well.  This is unfair and punitive.

I am not supported by my AP and she is not protecting me in the classroom.  She stated to me that I was being """"overly supported"""" because I had a full time mentor on the job, who is also the Unit Coordinator, and because I was being sent to PD classes, which I thought we were supposed to receive. 

I have documented through anecdotal's how severe things are in this classroom.   I don't understand when all these things are this severe that she has not taken more actions to protect the teachers in the room.  I need your support in speaking with my AP and the Principal.  I am a first year teacher, and student and I have a student teacher in the room as well, with the most difficult class in the school.

These students are violent and aggressive.  They have injured my para by giving her two herniated discs.  I have two rotating sub paras in the room.  No sub has remained in the class.  And the student teacher is leaving at the end of the May, her student assignment is over.  Which leaves me with one permanent para, and she is the one who is and was injured by other student's in the room.  

The student that stabbed and cut me does not have a one to one paraprofessional and the administration is afraid of the mother.  I have one more informal observation, and I don't know how I can teach, when I can't go back into the classroom.  When I think about entering the room all I can see is the blood dripping from my hand and making a puddle on the floor. 

I am requesting your assistance for another placement, and for a placement with another population, preferable alternate assessment.  But I cannot do this without your help.  Would you please assist in speaking with my AP/Principal to move out of the school and out of this classroom.   I have been ill.  I contracted Bronchitis twice, from the student's and am suffering from it now and on medication.  I still go to school and do the best I can everyday.  This is not the population for me.  I need your help.

Thank you,

Hi Charlene,

Jo Ann Cleghorne was stabbed in the hand by one of her students on Friday.  She has contacted us for support as she is scared to return to the classroom.  I have contacted a Behavior Response Team at Hunter to provide her with immediate support and provided her with counseling information.  We also contacted her field consultant and practicum instructor.  

Below is an excerpt of her email.  Is there an option for her to take a leave from the classroom this year?  Is there additional support Teaching Fellows can offer her?  
 

Please advise, 
Kristen 

I understand I can seek another site for the next school year.  My concern is finishing this school year.  I am traumatized.  I don't know if I can go back into the classroom.  And I have one more informal observation.  The classroom is out of compliance.  The children are and I quote from my AP ""Violent."" I am fearful for my life. 

The children that saw what happened are traumatized.  And Children mimic each other.  I don't know if something more violent will occur.  Will the AP take the student out of my class?  Will I have to tech this student through the rest of the school year?  I am worried about returning, I'm not at ease about re-entering that classroom and I don't know what to do. I'm not at 100%, I'm frightened, and I'm nervous.  How can I teach feeling that some other dangerous event will occur in that classroom?

I need your help to speak with my AP in regards to my continuing in this school throughout the rest of this term.

I will reach out to the Hunter Counseling team.  I don't know how to get to them because their hours of operation are 9-5 M-F, but I will try.  I need some mental health counseling.  This is very upsetting.

Subject: Questions regarding a current fellow at my school

Hello Carly, 

Hope all is well. I wasn't quite sure who to speak to regarding this matter, but I'm reaching out on behalf of my principal, Jodie Cohen, regarding a first year fellow that we have at our school, Etakibuebu Oyarijivbie.  She has significantly struggled with instruction and professionalism throughout this year and my principal was initially seeking a discontinuance. However, Jodie truly believes that Eta would be more successful in a middle school setting and gave her the opportunity to submit a letter of resignation so that her record would not be marred with the discontinuance. 

We're unsure of what the next steps for Eta are with the Fellows in terms of remaining in the program, but we wanted to see if there was anything that could be done to give her a second chance in a middle school setting and continue with the support of the fellows and her university program.  

I'd love to chat with you or someone else regarding this matter, if you're available.  Please let me know. I can be reached at 718-758-7213 or at this address. 

Thanks so much, 
Michele Tran

Subject: Re: Update regarding Student status

Hi Charlene,

Daniel is out of the office until 1/2 so I wanted to respond to this.  Shaheem did not meet the progress standards in the fall and failed a course.  He was dismissed and appealed which allowed him to return.  This spring semester he was unable to complete his Practicum course as 60% of the grade comes from field observations and he wasn't teaching.  He will need to retake this course.  Grades are being submitted for remaining coursework now.  When grades are posted, we can provide you with an update. 

Hope this is helpful,
Kristen

Hi All,
 
I hope youre doing well. 
 
Shaheem has recently popped up on my radar and it appears as though he may still be under investigation. Did he continue on with coursework this semester? How is he performing academically? 
 
He seems to be under the impression that he might be dismissed by Hunter, and I wasnt sure if this was accurate or not.
 
Best,

",University,University/School Issue ,"Email from Nuree on 5/25:

Thanks, Charlene. So are you or Sarah making that call to the principal? 

Meha  Shaheem is currently reassigned to a reassignment center, thus the 91IRPI location code. Hes currently under an investigation and when he gets switched to a 5BA staffing status, hell be removed from the reassignment center (as thats only for appointed teachers), and will be suspended without pay until the investigation determines his status to remain in the DOE. 

Thanks,

Hi All,

Just wanted to follow up on Catherine Eriguchi. It appears as though Pace will not be overturning their decision to dismiss her and the Principal will need to know that she cannot continue on for the upcoming school year. 

Best,
Charlene

Hi Nuree,
I looked up Shaheem in our payroll data and he is still active with the DOE but doesnt seem to be working at a school (unless I am reading the payroll data incorrectly). Nuree, any idea what IRPI is? There is no school address available in his payroll data. 
Thanks!

",University,university/position,"""Good Afternoon,
 Since February 15 I have been reassigned from my teacher position. I had two students who I was failing at the time make the claim I invited them over my house to watch the super bowl because of this I have been under investigation. My spring semester at hunter college ended today I failed the class not because I selected not to do the work I was reassigned the class required me to record myself teaching unfortunately since I'm reassigned I was not able to do so.  I don't want to fail out of the fellows program this is a situation I have no control of the matter I was not planning midway into the semester to get reassigned from my teacher position. The previous semester I received an A in a class just like this class so I'm confident I would've passed this class if it was not for my reassignment.  I'm completely clueless on what's going to happen next.""",University,Suspended w/o pay,Received notification from Office of Field Services that Fellow has been reverted to 5BA in the system and has been suspended w/o pay due to investigation.,University,Pending Investigation,"Received the update below from Hunter College.

Hi Ben, 

Anthony Rosado, a fellow at my site, was just informed his mother might pass away and doctors want him to go to Florida ASAP. 
We are going to do his formal tomorrow and then he's leaving to get on an airplane. 
I think this will equal 3 absences. Is there anything Nyctf can do? This is an unusual and serious situation.

Hey Anthony. The attendance policy is 2 absences. I suggest you go tomorrow... your mom is more important. I will mark you absent for tomorrow's skill building session and put family emergency in the notes section of the attendance. Contact NYCTF ASAP in order to let them know what's going on as well. The number is in the first row of the chart in this link. There is also a contact form.

I am wondering what the attendance policy is for the program when it comes to family emergencies?

Thanks,

>>                I want you to know and understand that I am commited to doing all that is required and asked of me when it comes to PST and the like. Tomorrow is my final observation for the week and I know how important it is. I am coming into school with the desire and pasion to do a knock out job for my last attempt to be part of the future Teaching Fellows teachers. But I have recieved solem news today when I arrived home and it concerns my mother. I expressed to you eariler last week that she was put into the hospital, and she has taken a turn for the worse. I was told by the doctors that she is near to the end and has little time left, that I should consider making it down ASAP. I want to ask if it would be permitted for me to leave after my observation to catch a flight at 1 pm. I have a deep concern for my future with Teaching Fellows and I understand how serious the PST classes are but I hope this situation my allow for some leniency.

in the last week
 This has to be the worst administrative support I have ever encountered in my entire life and as a result of the ineptitude of the financial aid department and it's staff, I have been homeless in the two months I have been enrolled at Lehman despite being qualified and approved for over $20,000 worth of federal loans. The problem? You have to pry it out of their evil iron fists first. I can't begin to tell you how depressed and destitute I have been since I was FORCED to go to this school. My program put me at this laughing stock of an educational institute. The only thing I have learned since I've been here is how to survive on the streets. Time is running out and so is what little money I have left... DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL!!!! I cannot emphasize how dangerous it is to be done the way that I have. HEED MY WARNING. I am STUCK and CANNOT leave even if I wanted to. DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL!!!

Subject: Letter of Distress (PLEASE READ)

To those who have the power to make a difference,


My name is Aaron D. Hunt (EMPLID: 23577897). Im a graduate student who recently moved here to participate in the NYC Teaching Fellows program. As a part of the program, I was assigned to Lehman College. Prior to my arrival, I made numerous attempts to secure direct loans from the financial aid department to supplement the cost of school materials (such as books) not covered by the DOE as well as living expensesconsidering the fact that as a born and bred Southerner struggling to keep myself afloat during my undergrad program, the cost of living was considerably cheaper and the wages were meager in comparison. However, since I began the process for securing financial aid for the Summer 2016 semester, I have ran into a considerable degree of obstruction, setbacks from both the NYC Teaching Fellows and Lehman, and ultimately, Lehman itself. While there were administrators who were able to support me marginallyjust enough to keep me sheltered throughout most of the Pre-Service Training part of NYCTF and Summer courses facilitated by Lehmanthe appropriation of financial aid has been delayed so much that now I am in a circumstance where I can no longer provide for myself the most basic human dignities: food, water, and shelter. Because I applied for aid for Summer and Fall of 2016, I was under the impression following several meetings with Mr. Hill, the financial aid director, that I would be provided aid for those semesters pending approval. It hurt me deeply to see that aid was deferred instead to the Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 semestersone of which I never requested, because I knew that I would be in a better economic condition to not have to borrow anything to cover the cost of both course materials and living arrangements. While I have been fortunate enough to be appointed a position as a teacher at Mott Hall V High School for this upcoming school year, it does not mitigate the immediate perils that I face at this time. I am without income for the next two monthsthe rest of August and September, and will not receive my first paycheck as a teacher until October. So it is dispiriting and gravely concerning that in light of the extremes that surround my condition. At this time, I am sleeping on trains (day and night), facing the threat of eviction from a storage facility that I need so desperately so that my stuff isnt all over the place, while having to contend with a dangerous climatic flux. This entire weekend I have endured consecutive days of 100+ degree heat indexes that have caused me to periodically experience the affects of heat exhaustion: I have awakened on trains dizzy with headaches, nausea, sleep deprivation, confusion, dehydration, and without the ability to use the bathroom when I need to. 

This is no way to treat someone who has consistently shown dedication and faith in the institutions that provide him with the opportunities to make beneficial contributions to teaching and the social, emotional, and cognitive development of adolescents in the classroom. I have been waiting so patiently and have been so gracious in spite of the diminutive affects of what support has been given toward mitigating the deplorable condition I have experienced. Please, with all of my substance, I implore of those who have the power to change the outcome of my current situation to please do all that you can now to do what is right and to bestow me the aid that I so desperately fought for specifically for this turbulent time in my lifewhen I need it most. I am hungry now. I am thirsty now. I am tired and sleep deprived now. I am depressed and morally degraded now.Not three weeks from now. Not when everyone gets back from their vacations. I havent had a reprieve from my adversities in over two years. I feel as though these mishaps have been so consistent and so repetitive that it is hard not to feel as though the difficulties Ive experienced have not been deliberate. Please help me. I am running out of time and money. I cannot afford to go two months without a place to sleep, food to eat, and water to drink and I dont deserve any of this considering how hard I workedthe things I have gone through in my life up to this point, graduating with honors, and working hard to earn those better opportunitiesjust to avoid something like this. Please help me. Financial aid is supposed to be approved for the Summer and Fall of 2016. Spring 2017 aid was neither requested nor authorized per the application I submitted. Mishaps like this is what has caused this situation to be prolonged and worsen. Please reach out to me as soon as possible.

",University,Additional support needed,"Hello Erika,

Aaron Hunt is one of our English Fellows from Savannah, Georgia. On June 22 I sent an email alerting you to his homeless situation and his lack of financial resources. Since then Lehman has made available, and will continue to do so, resources to support Aarons success in the summer program. However, we have recently learned that Aaron takes medication for depression and anxiety and, due to financial hardship, has been off medication for an undetermined length of time.

We have referred Aaron to the Lehman Counseling Center and will follow-up with him closely. Dean Fayne asked me to make you aware of this situation such that he can also be monitored at his academy placement.

Best,
Pedro

I informed Tristin that this is not something we want to encourage among Fellows and I also inquired what invoice would the Fellow show up on.

Hi Charlene,

I just spoke with our bursars office here, and they believe that it should be OK for students to take a class at another CUNY school on an e-permit, as the student would still appear on our roster. This only arises when a fellow lives closer to another CUNY school and prefers a shorter commute.

Thanks,

Hey Tristin,
 
If the Fellow takes courses elsewhere, we would only pay CCNY. With the e-permit, would they still show up on your roster? Or a different CUNY roster? Out of curiosity, why would the Fellow take classes at another CUNY?

Charlene

Hi Charlene,
 
Can you tell me if fellows are permitted to take classes at other CUNY schools using an e-Permit without having to pay out or pocket (i.e., the teaching fellows would pay for it)?

My name is Matthew Martin. I was assigned to attend St. John's University. Since I was assigned this university, my schedule has been changed three times by our liaison, Professor Anthony Napoli . Today, I attended my first class only to be told that my name did not appear on the class roll. Professor Napoli arrived at the classroom to tell the instructor that, in fact I WAS registered for this class and that I should remain seated. I stayed for the entire class. However, when I arrived home and was at last able to access the St. John's student site (MyStJohns)--for which we were only given instructions today--I discovered that I was registered for an entirely different class. I am now scrambling to contact my instructors and Professor Napoli to determine what is happening and how to make up my assignments. 

The above situation did not only happen to me. Today during orientation I witnessed SPED Math students being told that they were supposed to attend orientation and classes this morning rather than the afternoon. When they protested that the email schedule they'd received from Professor Napoli read that the time/place to meet indicated they should arrive in the afternoon, he waved away their concerns.

My experience with St. John's thus far has been very stressful. I understand that the Teaching Fellows is limited in what they can do in this situation, however, I am very concerned about my future, and that of my fellow Fellows, at this university going forward. Please be aware that there is a great deal of confusion at St. John's at the moment and I am not confident that it can be rectified.

best, Matthew Martin""",University,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks, you two. I just spoke with the school and I advised them that they should move forward with the termination. Theyll work with the HRD to draft a 10-days termination notice (standard for 5BA). Theyll send me either a copy of the notice or effective date of termination so we know to withdraw him. 

Thanks!

Hi Sarah, 

Unless he fails this semester, he is still in good standing. However, his GPA did drop below a 3.0 and he is currently struggling in coursework. Therefore, I am not confident he will raise his GPA once grades are released in May.

My apologies for just responding to this now. Do we have any additional information on this Fellow? Has he passed his exams? Is he in good standing at LIU? Hes currently working as a 5BA. 

Charlene, can you please inquire as to his standing at LIU and we can then make a determination.

Hi Charlene and Sarah,

One of the APs at 32K564 called to discuss Mariano Llorets potential termination. Based on what the school has shared and that the Fellow is not doing so well with coursework, Im inclined to have the school move forward with the termination. Let me know if you think this is the right or wrong move. 

Thanks,

Hi Charlene and Sarah, 

Thank you, Charlene, for the update. 

Sarah, pulling you into the convo. School is ready to terminate the Fellow. Hes not doing well in coursework. He will most likely be terminated and thus withdrawn. Anything else we should reconsider before I reach back out to the school and agree that termination would be the best move?

Thanks,

Hi Charlene,

This is the C27 LIU Fellow I mentioned to you earlier today. There are both performance and professionalism issues. Would you gather as much information about this Fellow from LIU  coursework, concerns brought to LIU by the FC, etc? 

The school is ready to terminate this Fellow so any information you can glean from LIU would be helpful on whether a termination is necessary or not. 

Thanks!

Subject: Professional Summary for Teaching Fellow Mariano Lloret
Importance: High

Good Afternoon, Ms. Choe,

Thank you for taking my call this afternoon. 
Below is the summary you requested regarding, Teacher, Mariano Lloret. Please let me know if you need additional information. 

Measure of Teacher Practice
Currently, under the teacher evaluation, Mariano 's overall rating is an ineffective. He demonstrates lack of growth in regards unit and lesson planning, in particularly, content knowledge and pedagogy. He has also failed to show progress in regards to engaging students in learning, using assessments in instruction and questioning and discussion techniques. 

In addition to his preparation time, Mariano is given an addition period a day to meet with his mentor daily to plan his unit and lesson plans and receive feedback. He is scheduled to receive feedback on his unit plans from the principal and assistant principal. He has missed these meetings or comes unprepared.

After each observation, in-person meetings are held with Mariano to give him specific feedback to further his instructional practices. None of the feedback suggestion has been implemented.

Special Education Caseload and IEP Completion
To date, Mariano, has completed one tri-annual and no annual reviews from the 16 students assigned to his caseload. Mr. Lloret, has received internal and external professional development surrounding IEP writing. In addition, IEP writing templates and exemplars have been shared to support his writing deficiencies. Unfortunately, none of the supports or resources has resulted in the completion of his assigned IEPs. Student IEPs remained out of compliance, until we switched his caseload to the IEP Coordinator for immediate completion.

Attendance Summary
Mariano had 7 absences within the first 4 months of school;
4 of the 7 absences resulted in an extended weekend (Friday and/or Monday);
3 of the 7 medical documentation was provided ;
Mariano was also late 3 times and was observed leaving early without permission which resulted in a letter to file.

Disciplinary Letters
Thus far, Mariano has received four disciplinary letters to file:

October 20th for failure to have a lesson plan; 
November 7th for not having a bulletin board after given an extension of over a month; 
November 7th for leaving work roughly 30 minutes before his contractual time on October 26, 2016;
January 25th for excessive absences.


Best Regards,
Ebony N. Singleton

Subject: RE: Denied OSPRA 104 request due to Go Pass

Good Afternoon,

Thank you for bringing your fingerprint status to our attention. While you do have fingerprints on file from your volunteering they are under our Go Pass data base and thus not eligible for your Teaching Fellows nomination. In order to rectify this we will need to resubmit the fingerprint images to the DCJS and FBI for the new position under the NYC DOE data base. 

This will not affect your standing with the Teaching Fellows program in any way but please note the fingerprint fee of $130 will have to be deducted from your first paycheck from the NYC DOE in September. We will also forward the fingerprint information to your TEACH account once the responses have been received.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

Thank you,

As I've said before, Relay is a totally inadequate program for Fellows to be in.  Due to their lackings, I am receiving terrible ""module assessment"" scores  - yet I am having terrific observations at my school. Compared to fellows who work at the same school I do, there is a clear contrast and I feel this is not fair.  I am completely unhappy with this ""university"" especially when their ""video compilations"" CANNOT be the basis of my RSA (because they don't have REAL GPA's) and not a single staff member from that school has actually stepped a foot in my classroom and has seen my teaching. My RSA is suffering because their ""cookie cutter approach"" is not at all relevant to my special education setting. I again would like to switch universities because this Relay program is a complete failure.""",University,university placement,"""Hello - 

I was wondering if there was any way my university could be changed. 
I have been completely disatisfied with my Relay experience.  As long as I am in their program, I feel there is no way I would ever be considered an effective educator or receive a satisfactory rating. Since there was no IEP/disabilities/special ed. focus during the summer during fellows' PST, I have been completely unprepared these first weeks of school.  Over the summer I was told my university would be the place to become better prepared for this, but a '2 hour Special Education Welcome Night' ONE time over the summer- where you're given a book and never hear about it again was pointless. I know there is much to learn (especially on the job) as a first year teacher, but Relay has not contributed to any of my knowledge.  I feel the classes are totally useless, as we have spent nearly 2 months on 'teacher identity' aka are you racist or not, rather than things first year teachers - especially Fellows - need to know.  I'd hate for future fellows to have to experience this terrible anxiety I have been dealing with, participating in a """"university"""" program that seems to be a complete joke.   Learning how to wag your finger in a student's face compared to real policies that exist has been a waste of time.

Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: Abigail Benavente, NYC Teaching Fellows candidate

Hi Shuvi,

I work at the Brooklyn School for Collaborative Studies. I got your name from Alyce Barr.

I am a school counselor at Brooklyn Collaborative, and have been the school's college counselor for the past 8 years.

Before that I worked at the Secondary School for Research, now Park Slope Collegiate, under Jill Bloomberg.

One of my former students, Abigail Benavente, who graduated from Research in 2008, just submitted an application for the NYC Teaching Fellows.

Abigail was one of the ten students we featured in Hold Fast to Dreams, a book which follows the life and experience of 10 NYC public school students over six years, as they work to get to and through college.

I would love to bring your attention to Abigail's application, and advocate in the strongest way possible for her candidacy.

Abigail is an incredible and inspiring person; she loves learning and is deeply committed to educational equity; and she has first-person understanding of the tremendous challenges faced by many of the students in our city's schools.

Abigail would be an amazing teacher and I'd like to think that she is exactly the kind of candidate NYTCF is looking for. Abigail is bilingual, and she would like to teach Math, though she is also open to other areas. She is enrolled for this spring in a Calculus course at Hunter, her alma mater, so that she can qualify for the Math Immersion Institute. Abigail has had to face some unique obstacles, and if there is anything I can do to offer additional information to support her application, I would be incredibly happy to do so.

I have worked with thousands of young people in the city's schools over these past 15 years. Abigail is, without a doubt, one of the most remarkable young people I have ever worked with. She should teach.


Josh

Ill be honest. I was only about two years out of college and was desperate to get out of a mediocre job. I had teaching experience abroad, so I told myself that I might as well apply.

Five years later, its quite a different story. I am now earning a huge salary and have been expatriated abroad until Spring 2016 by my company  hardly mediocre, and quite fortunate I know. I feel Ive grown quite a bit professionally and as a person since my last application. Five more years of life experience and five more years of business success must surely make me a stronger candidate.

The other difference is that I am not simply looking for a way out of my current job. I am much more intent on making an honest career change this time around. Ive been researching masters degrees and reading all sorts of teaching blogs. In fact, if I dont succeed in my application this time, I plan on enrolling at Teachers College in the fall. Because, as I stated previously, I no longer feel that I can consciously work in a for-profit industry. I want to directly contribute to society in a positive way. There is no better way than teaching. 

Another influence since my last application has been the many friends Ive made who are NYC teachers, including a math fellow in this very program. While all of my teacher friends arent shy about saying its demanding, hard work, they are also visibly much happier than my private sector friends. And theyve all encouraged me to pursue this dream.

The last motivating factor was the passing of my grandmother, who was a teacher for 35 years. It took her passing for me to realize what a noble profession teaching really is. I know thats probably clich by now, but its a selfless and undervalued profession. It requires complete devotion and commitment. The way people spoke of my grandmothers passion for her classroom really reminded me of that. Id love the chance to follow in her footsteps. So, Im very glad my journey over the last five years has led me right back here to her and to this program.

Her TAD had flagged that she used a printer at her TA after being explicitly told not to. When I spoke to Zhanna she named that this had been a miscommunication that she thought she had resolved with her coach already. Her tone remained professional throughout the conversation but she expressed some concern about feeling a little singled out by the repeated follow ups to her EPT CL. She asked a few follow up questions about her EPT CL mostly related to worries about her ability to complete the program and find a position in the fall. She named that she has been trying to improve her professionalism and improving a lot with her teaching techniques in the classroom. ,Professionalism,Updated EPTCL,"Call from Anna Kelly to Zhanna where we told her we updated her EPT CL and to remind her that moving forward she acts professionally throughout PST. Co-fellow raised his voice and she actually reported the incident. She offered testimony from others; Anna conveyed that we dont need testimony and have full context on what happened. Zhanna said she understood next steps.  
",Professionalism,Delivery of EPTCL,"I called Zhanna today to deliver her Essential Professionalism Traits Concern Letter. Zhanna expressed that she did not feel that she had been unprofessional in her emails and asked if this means that she is not allowed to bring up concerns with the program - I clarified multiple times that she is fully allowed to express concerns and give feedback, but it is essential moving forward that she is professional in tone and language when doing so.

Zhanna also expressed that she  would not have sent the unprofessional email to Michael if she had better understood his role - I reiterated that her communications were unprofessional regardless of the level of staff member and reset expectations for what professional communications should look like moving forward. 

She also expressed that she is considering dropping out of the program, and asked for next steps for resigning from the program. I shared these with her, but cautioned her against making the decision in a moment of haste, and reiterated her next steps to uphold the EPTs and remain in the program.

She expressed considerable concern because she has interviews scheduled this week, and asked if she could go on at least one of them. I firmly reiterated that she will need to cancel her interviews and cannot search for a hiring position until we see that she is able to uphold the Essential Professional Traits throughout the duration of the program.

I closed the call after about 20 minutes when Zhanna struggled to maintain a professional and calm tone, letting her know that I would send the EPT on TeacherTrack with my contact information so that she could follow up with any additional questions. ",Professionalism,,,,,,

The lesson was rated a 1 - pre-novice across all indicators. Afterwards, Megan engaged in a feedback conversation with Kerianne Harrison and myself. The following is a summary of that conversation:

- I advised Megan that her glow was the use of familiar commercials to engage her students. Her grow was in classroom culture, specifically around transitions and student idle time. 
- I advised Megan that the lesson observed was rated at pre-novice across all indicators. Referring back to low inference notes, the greatest concerns were with how she 1) supervised the transition from circle to group tables, 2) idle time, especially for the yellow group. Specifically, that the transition should have been announced after both videos (i.e., direct instruction).
- Transition between circle and group table - Megan had set up a system  of color coding in which students were expected to match the circle on their card to the circle on their group table. When Megan announced the transition, two students moved to their table right away. Another two to three students moved about 1 minute later. 
- Although the yellow group was already at their group location (which is also their circle location), they waited for their materials for about 4 minutes.

- I modeled how to execute a transition with a student, to show Megan how a paraprofessional may provide support for a student during transition.  

- We (Megan, Kerianne, and I) discussed possible strategies for Megan to use to ameliorate these issues. Specifically, Megan was advised to use more explicit What To Do directions in supervising the transition. Kerianne gave her three explicit directions: stand up, walk to table, match your color.  Megan then practiced implementing these instructions. 
- Kerianne advised Megan to create a visual for students (for the SmartBoard) and staff that delineate the groups by color. Megan was advised that she could use student names as well as their pictures.
- We asked Megan how she usually communicates her expectations to the paraprofessionals for student behavior and academics. Megan stated that she usually just speaks to them about this. I suggested using index cards with explicit instructions to communicate with paraprofessionals about her expectations for student supports. Megan stated that she was hesitant about giving index cards to paraprofessionals because the students may get hold of them and rip them apart. I asked her to try to do it anyway. That if she gave the paraprofessionals the index cards, it is unlikely that the students would take them and rip them apart.

- Kerianne advised Megan to create a powerpoint with student groupings and assigned paraprofessionals as a visual for the transition between the circle (direct instruction) and group work.

Student Idleness
- We also discussed the fact that the yellow group waited 4 minutes to get their materials. At first, Megan said that she did not think it took that long for the group to get their materials. Later she explained that the group did not receive their materials right away because she was circulating among the other two groups. I advised her that she could have dropped their materials off first, then go to the other tables (which already had the student materials on them). Megan said that she did not do this because of the tendency of the students in the yellow group to tear up and eat materials.
- We also spoke about the expectations for students who were not being engaged by Megan directly during circle time. Specifically, that these students should be engaged by the paraprofessionals when they are not being directly questioned by her. 

We reviewed Megan's glow and grow and next steps. Megan stated that her next steps are to 1) provide specific What To Do directions for students and 2) address student idleness by providing materials up front and communicating her expectations to paraprofessionals via index cards.

Megan said that she will create a visual with groupings for the Smartboard. To address the student idleness, Megan agreed to provide materials to the yellow group before checking in with the other two groups.

Subject: Miles Boyd - Follow Up

Hi Jazmine,

I wanted to share the information I received from Miles Boyd:

 Miles met with a hiring rep from Principal Cyprys school at a hiring fair, at which point the rep invited him to attend a demo lesson at the school, scheduled for this past Tuesday morning.
 When Miles got home, he mapped out the distance from his home to the school and decided that the school would be too far.
 He drafted a message to the hiring rep, John Nolan, but never sent the message and it stayed in his drafts.
 Miles does not remember hanging up on the principal.
 I reminded Miles of the professionalism expectations of the Fellows program, and he was very apologetic about the mishap. I also informed him that if we are made aware of further concerns, further action may be taken.

Let me know if you need more info. The principals email address is: acyprys@schools.nyc.gov

Marie

Additional Notes:
Principal Andrea Cyprys reached out with concerns about Miles Boyd. Miles was a no-show to a scheduled demo lesson and hung up on the principal when she called to ask where he was.

Hi Erika,

We received a call from Jarolyn Javier (Cohort 27) about changing her subject area. According to our records, her subject area is Bilingual Education 1-6, and she is requesting to switch to Special Education 7-12. Per Jarolyn, she received approval from Hunter to make the switch, and was told that you gave the approval to Hunter, so I wanted to touch base with you to confirm that you have authorized the switch.

Please let me know if I can provide additional information.

Thanks,
Heather

I hope this message finds you well and that you have been able to take some time for yourself this weekend after knocking out your first full week in the classroom!

I realize that you left still feeling a bit unsettled after the conversation with Donald and me about the concern you raised. For this I want to apologize. I want you to know that your insights and perceptions concerning the way staff addresses issues will be fully taken into account in the future. I also would like to thank you for coming to us both to address your concerns in the most professional manner. 

Since I didn't feel as though you were going to get a solid practice round in on Friday afternoon, we rescheduled your practice for Monday (Donald or me will reach out to you with the time). I will be in the auditorium on Monday morning by 7:15. Please find me in there so that we can talk through any other concerns you might have before starting out your week. I will also be available this weekend via phone/email should you want to talk through anything else you feel as though you did not get closure on Friday.

I truly hope that these steps can move us both forward to grow so that we are able to focus on the top priority - successful completion of PST.

Have a great weekend and take care!

She was pretty upset when I called her and told her she may need to defer to the next cohort as her TAD had communicated that everything would be fine. She also had a job so was not using her one absence a week for interviews so felt it was fine for her to use them to see the doctor instead. 
I told her I would have to speak to my team and get back to her -- she immediately got upset and started to cry so I told her I would call her back as soon as possible. 

I discussed with Anna and Lauren and we decided that we would not defer her unless she missed an additional day. I called her back to tell her this and she was still pretty upset -- she was crying a little (I could not make out exactly what she said) but understood that she was still on good standing unless she missed additional dates. I also asked her to contact the NYCTF office directly if she anticipated any absences.
",Pre-Service Training,Attendance ,"Hi David,
Thank you for clarifying!
Can you ask Fran to mark her present for the SBS she has been attending at the other site? Has she also been missing Field Experience? If she misses too much of SBS we may have to defer her to the next cohort as she wont be prepared to enter the classroom in the fall.
Best,
Meha

Meha-
Ruby had a seizure during SBS on Friday and had to be taken to the hospital. She is getting brain scans in Manhattan this week, and this Training Academy is close to her doctor.
Ruby has now missed three days including her impending absence tomorrow. I know this puts her over the limit, but she is a quality fellow and will be a great teacher. I hope that despite her excess absences, she can remain in the program.

She opened with ""Good Morning New York City Teaching Fellows, still don't have a job and calling back because you all never respond to me,"" in a sing song sarcastic tone. Maria is nervous that she will not find a position by the start of the school year and felt it was unjust that the position she had secured in an isolated classroom was not granted as it doesn't meet our hiring criteria. She said she felt ""strong-armed by the Fellows who have been no help at all to take a position in the Bronx and that would be a 3 hour commute for her."" I shared that we were not trying to do that and our aim as a program was to ensure Fellows had vacancy lists, hiring fairs, resume workshops and office hours next week to help Fellows find positions. She asked if those office hours meetings would involve our program, ""calling up principals on my behalf to ensure I get a job."" She became emotional and shared that her anxiety came from a place of wanting to have a job to support her family. I shared that I understood it is a stressful time and mentioned that many principals may have been out last week but will be in the office on Monday so it may be worth following up with emails to ensure that your message is at the top of their inbox when they return. She asked me ""do you think it's better that I don't have a job than if I have a job that doesn't quite meet the criteria of your program?"" I replied I couldn't answer that and she replied, ""Maggie have you ever not had a job or been in danger of not having a job?"" I shared empathy for her situation and reiterated next steps like checking the vacancy lists going out this afternoon, following up via email to principals who may have been out that she emailed last week, and signing up for office hours about hiring with a member of our staff. It felt uncomfortable and inappropriate to be confronted with those questions and while I tried to provide solutions, Maria seemed to feel strongly that the ""Fellows promised a job and now I'm not going to get one"" and asked me multiple times if I thought she would get a job by the start of the school year.

Attached, please find your Teaching Sample Planning Form. We ask that instead of uploading this to your TeacherTrack account, you bring 2 hard copies with you to your Selection Day. I'm also attaching the Selection Day Preparation Guide for your convenience.

The expectations for this event remain the same as the first time. You are asked to prepare and deliver a lesson using one of the objectives on the Teaching Sample Planning Form, and participate in all other Selection Day activities.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. Otherwise, we'll see you on April 7th!

Best,
Marie

Hi Frederic,

Thanks for your patience so far! Would you be able to attend a Selection Day on Thursday, April 7th at 4:45PM? Please let me know and I can update our team accordingly. Please note that Selection Days wrap up in April, so if you're still interested in attending another Selection Day, I would need to schedule you soon. 

Best,
Marie

Marie,

After giving your request ample consideration. I have concluded that I am open to a second selection day visit because feedback is vital. As for accommodations, I felt comfortable with the equipment I had with me that day.  ?In my professional career I use an illuminated magnifier and software designed for individuals with a visual impairment. It is my opinion that I had adequate access to the selection day event..

Thank you
Frederic

Summary
Fred received a NFA in teaching sample planning form. Candidate did not use the lesson plan template. Fred uploaded a word document with definitions and a list of steps to ratify the Constitution. Teacher and student interactions are not listed. There is significant misunderstanding of how to use the form. Lesson also does not contain a CFU.

Fred received a FA in CA and a FA- in CD. He stated the definitions and steps of ratification for the US constitution. He repeated himself a few times so students could copy notes. He did not ask a CFU beyond having students read the notes from the board. He talks about content but does model it. He did not provide examples or use a model to help students make sense of the information. Fred received a FA in MIT. He used his time wisely and recapped the lesson midpoint and at the end. For ES, he received a FA-. He had minimal interactions with participants. He called on 3 out of 6 students and asked them to copy notes. He also lectured for more than half of the lesson. 

In the initial direction during the GA, Fred did not use all components of WTD. He used sequential; however, he was missing specific/ concrete and observable. He applied feedback from colleagues and as a result, his revised direction was correct. He gave feedback to 1 out of 2 partners during the WTD. In the reteach, Fred used WTD correctly one time during the lesson, and missed other opportunities to include it in his lesson. He received a FA in CT for GA and RT. Overall, he received a NFA in CT because of the TSPF.

I would like Fred's application to be reviewed. He is severely visually impaired and this disability affected his performance. There were barriers to his learning without access. For example, he had trouble using the planning form online because of his sight. There was not a modification for him to succeed therefore, he created his own form. Also, he struggled during the group activity because he could not fully read the poster or the handout. He had a magnified glass; however, the pace of the group activity prevented him to fully participate. He was very verbal and participated as best he could. I surmise that the lack of modification for the worksheet accounted for his low rating in TSPF and GA. 

According to the rubric, Fred is a select out candidate because of NFA in CT.",None,,,,,,,,,

Hi Ben,

I have a Fellow who was in touch with the Fellows office yesterday because she had a contagious illness and had to leave to go to the ER on Monday. She is back today, but was also out yesterday. She said the Fellows office says they are determining whether or not to let her stay in the program and are supposed to let her know by today.  While she has had some minor mindset and professionalism concerns throughout the course of the summer, I do believe she will make an excellent D75 teacher and would hate for her to get pushed out of the program for staying home when she is contagious with an illness.  I don't know if this has any weight, but I just wanted to check in.

Thanks!

Lilly
",Pre-Service Training,attendance,"Staceyann returned my call to speak about her attendance. She told me that she was also absent today, putting her at 4 absences. She says she had to go to the ER yesterday as she was very ill and coughing up blood. She said that she was absent today as her doctor instructed her to stay home and provided her a medical note. 

She also told me that she missed her formal observation on Monday, and her TAD told her that she had to reach out to our office to change her formal observation to Thursday.",Pre-Service Training,attendance call follow-up,I called and left a message for Staceyann reminding her that she has used all of her emergency absences and asking her to call back with any attendance questions or concerns. ,Pre-Service Training,An email in response to a voicemail message this Fellow left me on my personal phone re: an Upcoming D75 School Tour,"Staceyann called my personal cell around 8pm this evening and left a message asking for my advice about attending a D75 tour she registered for tomorrow morning.  She mentioned she would have to wake up at 4 AM in order to attend and wanted to know if I knew about parking options near the school.  She didn't want to cancel without my advice. She asked me to call or text her back. She had access to my cell phone number because I provided it in an email to all registered Fellows in the event of an emergency.  Below is my email response to her.

Hi Staceyann,

I received your voicemail message. Please note that my personal cell number was provided to Fellows in the event of emergencies on the morning of the tours. For all future inquiries, you should reach out via phone or email to the NYC Teaching Fellows office.

I have not been to the District 75 school we are scheduled to tour tomorrow so I cannot personally speak to parking options. If you choose to attend the tour, I recommend you utilize Google Maps to identify nearby parking lots since I doubt the school has a lot (it is located in the East Village).

Given the intense commute you referenced in your message, I understand if you opt not to come and appreciate you letting me know your final decision before 8 AM tomorrow (via email).

Staceyann, please be aware that Pre-Service Training will require you to be in various places in NYC very early in the morning and you'll have coursework to attend until early evenings.  If commuting into the city is an issue for an 8 AM tour, you may want to consider alternate transportation or lodging options for the summer to make for an easier commute to your school and University.

Thanks,

Hi Daniel,

I just wanted to inform the special education alternative certification office that I have resigned from my teaching job due to health concerns. I was a part of the Teaching Fellows Program. 

I also wanted to know if we'd be receiving a 1098 form from Hunter? I looked on cuny first but nothing was available. 

Thank you,

At the beginning of April 2016 I advertised the position of a Chemistry teacher on New Teacher Finder. The following Teaching Fellow, Ethel Khanis ( Lehman College program) reached out for the interview. After the interview and the demo lesson on Tuesday, June 7th she was offered a position in our school which she accepted. We agreed that I will reach out to her on June 13th after a conversation with a Human Resources Director. In the time period between June 7th and June 13th we exchanged emails messages when Ethel asked a few clarifying questions about the culture of the school and other logistics.

On June 13th I emailed Ethel asking her to provide me with a social security number so she can be put on a Table of Organizations. After no answer from Ethel I called her on Thursday, June 16th, at which point she informed me that took a position at another school. There were 9 days between the time she accepted a position with us till the time I reached out to her due to her silence. She did not have  a courtesy to notify that she is not taking the position. The school lost 6 business days of hiring opportunities.

Hi Stephanie,

Jazzmin France is a 1st year teaching Fellow. Im sorry to hear that her principal is planning to let her go tomorrow. Per 5BA policy, however, it would need to be a 10-day notice. She will have until January to find and secure another position. If she doesnt secure a position by then, she will be withdrawn from the Fellows program. 

Best,

Good afternoon Nuree, 

Per the email below, 17K354 hired Teaching Fellow Jazzmine France (0903856) and have determined that she needs more help in the classroom than they are able to give.  She cannot complete a lesson on her own and constantly requires help.  The principal will be meeting with her tomorrow, and will inform her that she will be terminated.  Is this a normal occurrence for Teaching Fellows that are hired as long term subs?

Good day, 
Ive asked colleagues and received several different responses, but am reaching out to you for clarity. In the future, I will go to my liaison, but I have the union and principal waiting for a response. 

Jazzmine France (0903856) is a teaching fellow that was hired as a long term substitute at 17K354 after failing a state exam. Since the first day of school, Ms. France has proven herself an ineffective teacher and is actually not able to conduct an entire lesson on her own.  The principal is meeting with her today and wants to seek a different candidate for her 6th grade special education classroom.  Is the principal able to terminate the position of a long term sub (teaching fellow) at any time during the school year?

Joelle I did not arrive after 5pm on 06/30/16. Also me and Keisha never had a conversation about my tardiness.I have no problem with the 07/01/16 tardy I was super late that day. I do not have Jetas contact information. Will you be able to provide that for me?

Hi Jazzmin! I'm sorry but we are not on the same page about your lateness on June 30th. I remember you being later than you said (after 5, in fact), but since I was in the middle of instruction I had asked Keisha and Rozena to manage the attendance for me. After conferring with them both on Friday, July 1st, they were able to produce the times that everyone arrived, and noted that you were 35 minutes late. I know that Keisha had also spoken to you on Friday to clarify the difference in our accounts. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Jeta, as she was our site director during that time period and she might be able to better direct you of steps you can take to rectify any problems. Otherwise you can also speak to your current director about your concern. My apologies though, that I cannot be more helpful on this end. Good luck with the rest of your summer training.

HI Joelle this is Jazzmin from skill building at Brooklyn I hope that you are well. Is there any way to null the tardy from 06/30/16? I was literally a few minutes late and was still able to complete the Do Now. Its still very early in the program and things can come up. I wouldn't want to be kicked out of the fellowship for tardiness....

At the time, I was offered a sales role that seemed like a very exciting challenge, as it was quite different from anything I had done before. Ever since, I have taken on the challenge of a sales career and succeeded, earning a high commission every paycheck. This has certainly been rewarding, but it became clear in 2014 that I was not fulfilled by the work and that I missed working with students. I began to volunteer at a school, thinking that it would be enough. After a year at the school, I realized I only wanted to be there. I believe I will be a much more successful teacher now that I am more mature and have more professional experience. I have learned how to manage relationships with my peers, clients, and managers.

Statement: We believe we (Math Immersion Teaching Fellows) were misled by information provided by NYCTF and should not be responsible for the cost of our 30 requisite math credits. We are reaching out to ask that NYCTF honor our original written agreement by including the cost of requisite math coursework in the $8,000 financial commitment we made towards the cost of our master's program.

He called our office and spoke with me first, I then transferred the call to Meha. After his conversation with Meha, Anna followed up with him. 

- Joseph doesn't understand why he was placed on a PIP, he feels he has performed well throughout all of PST so far. He says that all of the staff at his TA have expressed he has performed very well previously and don't know what happened during his observation. 
- He doesn't understand why only one formal observation is taken into account and we can't consider all of is informal observations for this evaluation ""Why am I being punished for 15 minutes when I've performed very well for 100+ other hours""
- When explained that a PIP is meant as a support for Fellows and not meant to be punitive - he doesn't agree with that and feels like it is a punishment.
- By the end of my conversation with him before transferring him to Meha, he still wanted to protest being on a PIP even after explaining that he is not able to. 
- Throughout the conversation Joseph repeatedly interrupted and would talk simultaneously. ",Pre-Service Training,PIP Questions Follow Up,"I called Joseph to follow up on his call with Meha, as he wished to speak with someone else.

Joseph was concerned that he was placed on a PIP based on his formal observation ratings, given that he feels he has performed well in his informal observations and given his performance in the non-anchor techniques. I explained our process, referred him to the PST Handbook for more context, and reiterated that PIP is not punitive but is a support to ensure that he is able to work with his Coach on his development areas to ensure he is successful during training this summer.

Joseph clarified next steps for performance moving forward, and we discussed how he can work with his Coach to improve in the anchor techniques, non-anchor techniques, and in observations using the Instructional Framework.

Joseph was concerned about the impact of the Performance Improvement Plan on his ability to be hired - I clarified the timeline on which the vast majority of Fellows are hired (early August, after PST), He also questioned how many people who receive the support of a PIP ultimately successfully complete PST - I shared the context that is shared in our Fellow materials, that the majority of Fellows on PIPs, through focused work and growth and development with their coaches, go on to successfully complete PST.

Joseph let me know multiple times during the call that I am very well trained, and that I can tell my boss that I am very well trained, and that he would have trained me the same way when he was working in the corporate world.

Joseph asked if he could show up on Wednesdays and do nothing, since he is not being observed on those days. I clarified that he is still responsible for his students' academic development on Wednesdays, and responsible for working at all times to develop and grow as a teacher, even if he is not being formally observed. 

Joseph asked if there is an appeals process, and I let him know that there is not an appeals process.",Pre-Service Training,PIP Concern,"Meha spoke with this Fellow about his Performance Improvement Plan. Notes from her call are below.

- Joseph Prisco comes from the corporate world, and doesnt feel like, in his past experience, performance has been based off of 1 observation. Meha explained the multiple measures approach to him, but he is ultimately upset that he is on a PIP based on one 15 minute observation.
- Concurrently, he claims that the staff at his site (TADs, his coaches), think he is performing really well, and also dont understand why he is on a PIP  they just did it because they had to.
- He also says that the observation that contributed to his PIP was on a day where he threw his back out. Part of what hurt his score was about idle time, and missing instruction, which he attributes to his back injury
- Ultimately, he wants his informal observations to be taken into account, not just the two formal ones, since this would be more equitable from his perspective and capture his overall performance
- Lastly, he was told that he would have to wait till decisions to go back in the job pool. Meha clarified this, but he still doesnt feel OK about the implications of a PIP on his job search.",Pre-Service Training,,,,,,

""Hello!Today I received a message indicating that I was either absent one or tardy twice. I was marked tardy on Friday afternoon to training only because I had to address a last minute class change with my CT. I explained this to the coaches. I understand there are no excused absences but I just want to reiterate that the situation was not due to negligence, but because I wanted to make sure I could lesson plan for the right class for Monday - it was totally out of my control!Anyway, Danielle told me she had to mark me tardy for this instance. I have never been tardy at any other instance - I believe there was a mishap! Can you please confirm with me when I was tardy, and if there were any notes along with that?

We will not receive her test results for at least 2 more weeks. I was wondering if I can possibly have my acceptance deadline extended for a little? I can't accept even if I want to until I know more about my mother's condition. And if, hopefully, her condition is not serious I will begin looking for housing at NYC so I can relocate there. If there's anything else I can do, please let me know. Thank you.

DN: Jia sent that on 2/5/16, and we have granted her an extension on her acceptance deadline for one week - until February 23rd, which she agreed would give her enough time to hear back from her mother's doctors and be able to make a decision to commit to enrolling.

Dear Charlene,
We learned late this week that 2 of our TF 2017 students dropped:
Schelpat, Tyler  Biology 
Eriguchi, Catherine  Adolescent 

Both resigned their teaching positions and are therefore dropped from the Pace Teaching Fellows.

Hello Nuree,

No this is not a district 75 school.  that being said now the principal has to be informed she cannot hire Ms. James Bernard.  Im not sure why she is going to other schools if she was informed she can only work in D75.  This school is in District Ten.

I will assist the principal in cancelling the nomination.

Thank you

Hi Marian, 

That's great that the principal is hiring her for the coming school year - great news! Is this a D75 school? Because she's a Fellow who was selected specifically for D75, she must secure a position for the next school year at a D75 school. The Fellow must speak to her university coordinator about this position to see if she can take this job since I'm assuming this wasn't a D75 school. 

Additionally, principals cannot hire Fellows for the summer, as they are assigned to summer school by the Fellows program. We call the summer schools Training Academies and my colleagues have spent many long hours cultivating relationships with schools to establish our Training Academies, where Fellows are assigned in large groups where they are supported by our Summer Fellows program staff (Coaches, Training Academy Directors, and NYCTF skills-building session instructors). 

Please let me know if you have any additional questions!

Best,
Nuree

Let me know if I can help with anything else,

Hi Principal Scrogin,

Thank you for your message. To confirm, is your school a D75 school? D75 Fellows can only take positions within D75 schools, so I wanted to double-check.

Carly and Team,

I'm resending this from 5/16. I nominated one of my D75 inclusion paras for the fellows, and he was admitted. I want to hire him as a teacher, but my DBN is not D75. Can I still hire? Fredy Banegas SS 082-78-2931

Angela shared her concerns with the topics of conversation during coursework at Relay, stating that she was not comfortable speaking up in class and that the topics - white privilege and the Black Lives Matter movement - made her uncomfortable. She asked about other SPED programs and when she could transfer. I told her she could not transfer, and recommended that she speak with faculty or advisors at Relay about her concerns. She said she was not planning to do that, as she was uncomfortable speaking at Relay. She claimed that if she was not going to be transferred, she would file a grievance with Relay and the NYC Teaching Fellows program. ",University,Request to transfer universities ,"Fellow called in and spoke with Gianna and was told we were unable to move university placements at this point. she asked to speak to someone else and the call was transferred to me:

She feels very uncomfortable at Relay and would like to transfer her university immediately.
A lot of the conversation hovers around race and she feels uncomfortable voicing her opinion as its the minority opinion.
They spent 40 mins studying cops and the black live matter movement and she felt like people were almost ragging on cops but then said she doesnt want to phrase it that way. She ultimately left the class before it finished as she felt that comfortable. She also mentioned that the content of her lessons was completely irrelevant. 
When I asked her if she had spoken to the professor, any other faculty member or the dean about her concerns she said she didnt feel comfortable speaking to this particular professor.
I encouraged her to speak to other staff (including her own Faculty Advisor) she again said that she was uncomfortable and just wanted to be transferred as she feels like an outsider. 
She feels that her circumstances are extenuating and feels she should be given the option to transfer.
She said that if she was not transfer she was going to file a grievance against Relay. 

She seemed completely unwilling to consider speaking to anyone at Relay to resolve the issue and the only thing she wanted to discuss was how she could transfer universities. 
At the end of the conversation she mentioned that her commute was very long but it was now no longer about that. I checked with Gianna who mentioned that she first wrote in asking to be moved because of her commute (which we told her was not possible) and then wrote in saying that she would like to transfer universities as she does not agree with the philosophy at Relay.
Erika offered to give her a call on Friday 10/7

Both as a product of public school education and as parent of school aged children, I have interacted and collaborated with a multitude of teachers whom have become permanent and influential parts of our lives. I have seen our system make huge strides in improving the lives of our children. With the development and implementation of pre-K programs to the evolution of special education, I am enthusiastic about the tools that have been added to the curriculum and the Department of Educations renewed commitment to the development, progress and excellence of our students. 

In addition to my commitment, I have professionally and personally developed my ability to facilitate an effective learning experience as a corporate trainer. I have been afforded the opportunity to take a few classes that I trust will be helpful additions to the skillset necessary to becoming an educator. With the additional skills I have a deeper understanding of the cognitive and learning strategies that should be employed in each and every classroom. I have also had the added experience of structuring and leading an impactful place of learning in my role as a trainer. It is safe to say that I am a work in progress, willing to absorb more knowledge, tools, participate in collaborative learning/teaching experiences to further this knowledge and become an effective educator for the benefit of our future scholars.

Subject: Student of Concern

Hi Charlene,

I have a student from Cohort 27, Miguel Rivera who is going through some challenges at his work place. His principal has contacted our field consultant that the student may be released from his assignment, and Miguel has confirmed that he is going through these problems. The principal stated that Miguel has become disrespectful and that his behavior with administration is a major factor aside from in class issues. I urged him to reach out to Teaching Fellows because I do not know how much Hunter can support issues directly at the school building (he has no such issues at Hunter) but Miguel mentioned that he did not know who he would reach out to at Teaching Fellows.

Do you have someone to recommend him to or can your team reach out to figure out more about this situation? I am very concerned.

Keep me posted.

Best,

Ive become a stronger candidate for the fellowship position because Ive experience an increase in valuable life experience and accomplishments. 

Since my last application to the fellowship program, I and my wife have welcomed a daughter into this world, who is currently four years old. Ive enrolled my daughter in swimming lessons, dance class, French lessons and regularly take her to the museums. By presenting these activities to my daughter, Ive witnessed her cognitive development and learned that once a child feels safe and happy, they are fully receptive to innovative learning, creative ideas and complex information. 

Ive also had the opportunity to volunteer as a teacher with the Citizen School organization, which partners with public middle schools in low income communities. The experience was very exciting because I managed to recruit an individual from the advertising professional to assist me with teaching the class. We presented the advertising education to the children and experienced them being receptive and creating their own advertising ad. There were instances where some of the class participants were disruptive and we learned to approach them in an empathetic manner to resolve the disruption. Our teaching motto was keep it fresh, and entertaining and we rewarded positive behaviors by surprising the children with pizza pies and snacks.

I had the pleasure of working for the largest and most prestigious museum in the world, which is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Museum was a hub of creativity and wealth of artistic knowledge.  Having direct access to the education, special events and Curatorial department of the museum enabled me to be creative and think outside the box. The education department created a variety of programs to engage toddlers and teens to be early and regular patrons to the museum. Educational programs such as Art Explores, which are tours covering a wealth of art topics for students between the ages of 11 to14; and Family programs which offered story time reading and classes for toddlers. Experiencing and witnessing the success of these programs, through a high participation rate and seeing the excitement of the children, was another confirmation on how receptive children are to creative and innovative ways of learning.

All of my experience from parenthood, volunteering as a teacher and working in a hub of creativity has further heighten the perspective that a child is capable of learning anything and everything if they are provided with an environment where they feel safe and free to inquire and express themselves. As a result of my experience, I will approach teaching with a renewed creative point of view that is empathetic towards the students to engage them in learning.

Subject: Sundoes Elbery

Hi, Charlene, 

I wanted to provide a quick update on Sundoes Elbery. Sundoes came today with her transcript in hand. We are happy to report that we are able to keep her in the program with her current cohort (Cohort 27). 

Please let me know if you have any questions or next steps.

David said the Relay enrollment team had reminded Sundoes upon admissions and again in September that she must submit these by October 1 to remain enrolled. Failure to submit this documentation meant she must be dropped from Relay. 

Relay informed Sundoes of her dismissal before letting me know. Although asked if Relay could provide a week or so to allow Sundoes to get her transcript, they said they could not reverse their decision. On Oct. 19th, I informed Sundoes school of her removal from the program. ",University,,,,,,

Hi! I have been in contact with you guys before regarding a medical situation. After previous surgeries with my hand-I am now having complications and after seeing my doctor during TCI training-I need to see a radiology specialist in Manhattan. I have been going back and forth with appointments and finally, the best they can offer me is a 2:00 appointment July 1st (I will leave early from autism training) or an 8:30 appointment on July 8th (I will miss summer school). So I am hoping you can help with this situation. Thank you! ",Pre-Service Training,,,,,,,,,,,,

Briana, 

Your lesson plan for Tuesday 7/12 has not been submitted. As stated in previous emails as well as our in-person coach group meeting, the deadline to submit your lesson plan was yesterday, Friday the 8th by 11:59pm. 

Since you did not meet this deadline I can not guarantee that I will be able to review your lesson plan and give you feedback. Please upload it to your google drive folder as soon as possible, and I will try my best to review it. 

Please remember that your role and work this summer during PST is to ensure that our summer school students receive the best classroom instruction so that they can be successful in the classroom. Creating strong lesson plans and meeting all deadlines will help ensure that we do right by our students.

Briana, 

I just wanted to follow up after our discussion today. Since you stated that you would not be using the lesson plan you submitted for your observation tomorrow, please submit to me your lesson plan by midnight tonight so that I can be prepared to visit you tomorrow. 

The lesson plan deadline for your Thursday formal observation needs to be met as well, today by 5:00pm. 

I look forward to seeing your work in action tomorrow!

Briana, 

During our coach conversation we revised your lesson objective using the 4M's technique. We also discussed using experimental scenarios from past Regents exams and short answer responses to assess if students are reaching the objective. 

Please revise the lesson plan to include the revisions we made together. Upload the document to your google drive folder as a word document (.docx). This needs to be completed by 9:00pm tonight so that I can review before your formal observation tomorrow. 

Thank you and look forward to seeing the feedback in action tomorrow!



Her observation report was put into her observation folder on google drive on Thursday 7/14 at 2:30pm. On her written observation report it states under next steps: 

Focus for Next Observation 


 Essential content - students will be engaged in the lesson when they are challenged with rigorous, high paced work that is aligned to the Living Environment Regents. All objective should follow the 4M TLAC technique. 
 Feedback needs to be implemented immediately


In addition, Briana was sent to a lesson planning RCS on Thursday 7/14 that focused on the 4M TLAC technique. There was no objective written on lesson plan for information observation, 7/19, submitted last night. 


Please let me know if you need any other information or documentation.

Thanks so much for clarifying and responding so quickly. Yes, you are correct: missing more than 20 minutes of a session counts as an absence (in this case you could have marked it as a tardy since she was partly present).

Ill make a note in her file and let her know that this will be counted as an absence. Just for record keeping purposes, in the future, can you enter any attendance issues like this as an FYI so its flagged to our team? Thanks for your hard work!

Subject: Re: Attendance for Parveen Keynejad

Hi Lauren,
Parveen was present on 6/22, however she left more than 30 minutes before the session because she had to attend ""her best friend's grandfather's wake"".  I made a note in her attendance that  day. I instructed her to contact your office but, after what she said were there failed attempts, she decided to leave early. After conferring with Jeta, I was advised to mark her absent since she missed at least one quarter of the session.
Best,
Sherrie

Sherrie, 
 
Good evening. I just spoke to Parveen Keynejad about her attendance issues and wanted to loop you in. I told her that she needs to be present at all components of PST and that we have her recorded as absent on 6/22, 35 mins late on 6/24 and 28 mins late on 6/27. Based on our policies, this is three full absences. She denies that she was absent on 6/22, and acknowledges that she was late the other two days for an emergency. Would you be able to check your attendance records and notes from 6/22 and let me know if Parveen was in fact present?  6/22 would have been the What To Do session.  
 
Thanks!

",Pre-Service Training,Attendance,"I spoke with Parveen today about her absence and two latenesses (Absent on 6/22, 35 mins late on 6/24 and 28 mins late on 6/27). She claimed that she has not been absence at all, but acknowledges she was late on two occasions. She said those two latenesses were due to medical issues she's been having. She said she was at the doctor and can provide documentation. I asked her if she anticipates any additional absences, and she said she is still waiting for test results. I gave her my number and email so she could be in touch. I also explained that if she needs to miss additional days, she may not be able to complete PST this summer, since it's important that she's present at training. She said she understood and would follow-up with me. ",Pre-Service Training,,,,,,

Hi 
I have a change in school that was not by choice. The school where I started out (09X568) could not keep me as Special Education teacher because they didn't have enough special education students enrolled and it had budgetary implications. I interviewed and was transferred to Mott Hall High School 05M304.
Will this change in school affect my eligibility?

Hi Wendyliz,

Thank you for your message.

We do have a strict attendance policy as each day of PST is very important, and we only allow for two emergency absences for the duration of training. Any additional absences, aside from these two emergency absences, can result in withdrawal from the program. 

If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out via the Contact Form.

Best,
Heather

Hi, I will be absent for PST July 5th, 7th, and 8th. I will  not be in the state and already had these plans prior to my enrollment in the program. However, I understand that week is the first week of teaching. Is there something that can be worked out in regards to the absence? Thank you and hope to hear a response soon.Martinez

She said that she was not late on 7/19 and would speak to her Coach about this. We also spoke about her previous absences and she said that she just moved to New York so wasn't clear about how to get to her Training Academy as she wasn't familiar with NYC. Her TA was switched during the first week and she was late getting to her new site. She also had to go to the emergency room on one occasion which is why she was absent.,Pre-Service Training,Retract Training Academy Appeal,"""Good Afternoon, I am writing to you as I need to retract this appeal. I have booked and am in the process of moving closer to my original site in the Bronx at X131 Albert Einstein. This new location in Brooklyn is very far from my new place.

For the past five years, I have been lucky enough to work in various areas of the music industry, a dream job for just about any young 20-something. From the moment I graduated from New York University, I pursed this career path with such rigor that it consumed my waking hours. My heart would not have been in education, as I still had an obsessive desire to advance within the music industry. I feel that I have matured to the point where I now realize that dreams dont die - they change. What I once wanted as a young college student is very different than what I want today. Because of this particular point of view, coupled with a strong interest in working with youth and making an impact, I think that I am a much stronger candidate and I would make a fantastic teacher. I want to be the one to advise and guide future generations of young adults in the world and although it is a great challenge, it is a challenge I will take on with incredible confidence. I am grateful for my experiences working in the music industry because if it was not for the risks I took in within that business, I would not have come to this decision. I know that teaching will not be easy, but it is the most rewarding career that I hope to pursue.

Hi Patricia and Principal Demeo,

Thank you for reaching out. Unfortunately, we are unable to change the subject areas of Teaching Fellows. Fellows are selected and assigned specific subject areas because of their previous coursework in the assigned subject area. In addition, unfortunately, business is not a focus subject are for the Teaching Fellows nor for any other alternative certification program. 

Im cc-ing my colleagues on the school staffing support side of the office who are better equipped to assist. 

Best,

Dear Patricia:
 
As we discussed earlier today, we have had a devil of a time hiring Business teachers.  However, I have had the good fortune to meet two Teaching Fellows who hold Transitional B licenses in Mathematics.  I wanted to know if we can contact their folks to change the Transitional B licenses from Math to Business.  
 
I have spoke to the candidates noted below and each person has stated that they want to have the licenses changed in order to join our staff.  
 
The candidates are:
 
Eileen M. Kelly

Kevin Ross
SS#: 132-70-2825
 
Please let me know if you need additional information and thank you for your assistance.

I am writing in response to an email you sent me earlier today about additional materials needed to determine my ESL eligibility. I have pasted your original email below as a reference. 

As for the information you are looking for, it is a bit complicated so allow me to explain:

As you noted from my transcript, I took 11 credits of Arabic in college at the University of New England. The courses were taught every year by a different Fulbright scholar and only Arabic I was offered. I was not satisfied with that so every new semester, I convinced the professor to do an Arabic independent study with me so I could further my learning. 

After Arabic III, I decided I wanted to continue studying Arabic post-graduation. I applied to the American University in Cairo as well as Middlebury College's Arabic Language program. I was accepted to both but chose to attend AUC's Arabic Language Intensive Program in Egypt for a more immersive experience. The trouble was that because of a technicality and because it would take place in the months after graduation, I wouldn't get credit for the courses unless I signed on to pay a full semester's tuition to both universities. The Dean at UNE, however, wanted to help me so he agreed to have it count toward my Arabic III class by way of a """"Study Abroad Experience."""" It is listed on my transcript as such (SAB - Summer Semester 2010) but doesn't adequately connect the two.

This gets more complicated because I had asked for an official copy of my certificate when I arrived back in the United States. That was around the same time the revolution broke out in 2010. As you can imagine, the postal service there was not functioning as we would have liked and I never received it. I have requested it a number of times since but other problems have come up on their end (they need a certain kind of credit card or need someone in Cairo to actually pick it up for me).

I can and will try again to see what I can have them send me electronically as soon as possible but it's proved futile in the past. I can also have a professor at the University of New England who signed off as my study abroad liaison write some kind of confirmation that I was enrolled and successfully completed the program.

As for the program, I took 20+ hours of classes a week while I was there in June and July of 2010. Classes were in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and colloquial Egyptian. I also took cultural classes on things like Islam. Below you'll find a link that further explains the summer program I was involved in.

I hope I have adequately explained this unusual situation. I'm also uploading a copy of this correspondence and any other materials I can think of that would help to Teacher Track to help streamline this process. I'm more than happy to provide any additional information you'll need and I certainly hope this doesn't hurt but rather helps my application!

Thank you so much for all your time and efforts and I hope I have the pleasure of working with you in future.

Hi Marisa,

Thank you for checking in! We wanted to do a last verification of your coursework for your ESL eligibility. We see that, in addition to your 11 Arabic credits, you also received an Arabic Language Certificate. Can you please provide more information regarding this certificate so we can have it on file? Was this certificate accepted for college credit?

Please submit your response via the Contact Form.

Kindly,

That was probably apparent through the responses that I provided back then.  Teaching has always been an option as something I could see myself doing.  The motivation behind reapplying firstly lies with the idea that teaching is now, not just an option that I can choose...  Through personal exploration of what drives me in life, I have discovered that teaching is something that I believe I am more than capable of and I know it is what I need to do.  It's what I want to do.  I have always been fascinated with what people do for a living.  I have surveyed others to investigate why they do what they do, and gauge the level of happiness and self-fulfillment that it provides for them.  I wouldn't have known then what I think I do now about why I am ready.  So, after learning for myself that I want and need to be doing something purposeful with my time and energy--I am extremely motivated by my Mother.  I previously mentioned that she recently retired from teaching Special Education.  She had always wanted to be a teacher and with having children young, finally had the resources to go back to get her masters degree in her forties.  It is never too late to realize what we are meant to do for society and then go forward and achieve whatever goals we set forth for ourselves.  My wonderful, capable Mother taught me that.  She was contacted (after retiring) to come back on a part time basis.  Clearly, she was generating results in her field.  With her no longer in the classroom, the city is one short.  I would be completely humbled to be selected into this program that would allow me the resources to pick up where she left off.  What truly motivates me now, is my honest yearning to make a difference where I can and where I am needed.

In my follow up message to Laura's coach about her PCL, I mentioned this and suggested following up about what might have been misunderstood. My understanding was meeting times had been provided in a graph, but Laura requested an email and that email was never sent to her with the schedule.

Laura was professional on the call and clearly took the letter seriously but shared some confusion about how much she could accomplish with next steps in the remaining 2.5 days of PST. She also expressed anxiety about being able to keep the position she has already formally accepted and secured. I made clear that her ability to formally accept positions is contingent on her successful completion on PST and she would hear more about her status in the program on August 8.

When the room was discussing the Do Now question, ""How have you implemented elements of culturally responsive teaching in your classrooms?"" Jesse asked the LIs in an aggressive tone, ""What are you actually asking of us here?"" He said that he felt as though this question was targeted at ""minority students"" and he thought the term should be ""individually responsive teaching"". When his peers responded and offered suggestions and ideas, Jesse again pushed back and said he ""didn't understand"" what anyone was asking of him. His tone continued to be agitated.",Professionalism,Issued EPT CL,"Issued EPT CL to Jesse. He shared that it was a misunderstanding during an academic discussion (inappropriate tone during SBS around culturally relevant teaching) and he has already distributed a letter apologizing for the behavior. He mentioend he was going through some personal things last week and is also new to this type of professionalization. He wanted to be sure there were no new issues over the past two days and he said that we should have seen a big over the past two days. Today he had his formal observation and received threes in all components. He said he'll be 100% compliant in any way and the offensive language is a misunderstanding from an academic standpoint; he's upset about that and he came from a competitive grad school where they would act differently and speak differently in class and argue a lot. 
",Professionalism,FYI ,During skill building Jesse was n his phone. I asked him to put the phone away to which he looked startled and put his phone away. Five mins later he got up and walked out of the classroom. After being gone for 8 mins he cam back holding a skateboard and proceeded to interact with his cell phone.  He raised his hand in the middle of the session and declared that none of this stuff worked for his particular students. I offered some suggestions and reminded him that were building a teacher toolkit. Some fellows who work in his class  offered some suggestions to which he explained that the kids don't seem to care and that nothing works. I notified my TAD as well as Jesse's coach. ,Pre-Service Training,FYI ,"During Skill building Jesse is extremely withdrawn. He was constantly on his phone and having off  task conversations. i had to verbally ask him to put his phone away. When asked, he put his phone away and took it out again after 5 mins. I have sent several anonymous group emails about telephones. I will follow up with a one on one conversation.  ",Withdrawal,,,

I like to think I have gotten better. I have overcome the obstacles listed in the prior questions to become a father, husband , and nursing school graduate, who in his heart is a teacher and a good one.  I still love to learn and teaching my 5 year old and 2 year old how to read and simple tasks has rekindled my passion for teaching. You see this week I was in Target and my daughter and son, she  wanted to ready Dr. Seusss  Mr. Brown can moo can you ?  and she did.  Then I asked her What are those words examples of Jade?  she replied ,  Onomatopoeia! because we havent discussed the term neologism . My son James he is counting to ten on his own and is reading  Dig Dinosuars dig. He likes to start at six because it has sticky cement, but he will read it through to ten where they jump in the pool they just built and he start over again at one. 
 They can do this because I am home with them, I am bored;  they are sponges for knowledge and I am a teacher in my heart of hearts.  We are almost at 1000 books by kindergarten for my daughter and will most likely be at 3000 when my son starts kindergarten .   They are bright and I am cultivating them, teaching them not only literary techniques and math equations, but also someone loves them and wants best for them.  Someone is there for them when they cry at night or in the morning, and picks them up when they are down. I have been doing this all their lives because my father and mother set the example.  To me fatherhood has become the penultimate teaching experience.  My experience have made me better and enriched my life and I have so much more to give. That is why I want to think I am the best candidate you have. that and 25 times 25 is still 625.

 My desire is  be an educator influenced my decision two year ago to  apply to the Teaching Fellows Program, but my application was denied.  However this did not deter me, I was later nominated and accepted the position as a substitute teacher. In this capacity I have been able to positively impact the lives of young minds. As I interacted with other educators and students, I was even more resolute that I wanted to become a teacher. I also independently studied for and was successful in completing some New York State Teacher Certification Exams these included the   Academic Literacy Skills Test, Educating All Students and Assessment of Teaching Assessment Skills. I am also awaiting the results for the Student with disabilities and Multi- Subject exams.
I am a stronger candidate because of the knowledge and experience I have gained, also my determination did not waver; I am going to be a special education teacher.  The Teaching Fellows Program I know will assist me with the  skills I will need to make this dream a reality.

Candidate is nonverbal and would need ASL interpretation. 

Spoke with the Accommodations Coordinator within the DOE, who provided some suggestions but wasn't able to provide a definitive answer of what exactly would be the accommodations because she would need to submit an Accommodations Request form with medical documentations to determine that. He shared that D75 is often very supportive of meeting teacher accommodations. 

In my phone call with NV and Hunter this morning, Hunter is able to provide interpretative needs for coursework but it would be up to DOE and NV to provide during summer school and other training sessions, as well as when she is teaching during the school year. NV suggested a hybrid way to support this candidate if accepted and enrolled - enroll her as a D75 Fellow at Hunter and have her take courses with Chem UTR residents - so that she can work in a D75 school and still be earning her certification in Chemistry. 

Spoke with Erika and moving forward with NV's proposed hybrid model would be too complex. 
(1) Hunter does not have a D75 7-12 cohort, only a 1-6 group. 
(2) She can only be in one program. This hybrid model would be too complicated and would involved too many staff resources and adjustments to both programs to meet the needs of one Fellow. 

Hunter will be following up with their folks. There is a call scheduled for Friday, 5/6, to touch base with Hunter and NV. ",None,,,,,,,,,,,,

While I felt the call to teach, I admit I held an over-idealizedeven naiveview of teaching. Since then, I have taken increasing responsibility in the classroom: tutoring small groups and after-school clubs, assisting teachers, co-teaching and finally becoming a non-certified temporary teacher (and interim head of department) for one term. Now, after considerable time spent in different schools (including low-income London public schools), I feel more grounded in reality, more experienced and consequently more resolved and skilled to enter the classroom and start making a difference. 

The meaningful relationships I developed with young people have emboldened my determination to become a teacher. It was a privilege to spend time with (low-income) youth in inner-city London schools and to research and apply ways of raising their achievement. Additionally, I have since earned an MA with the highest grades of my cohort, adding successful graduate school experience to my classroom experiences. Finally, having lived in Europe (Spain and England) for a decade since applying to the Fellows, I have gained a greater understanding of different cultures and of the urgent societal value of investing in quality public education. At 39, I am a seasoned individual, a reflective practitioner and a career changer with a solid professional background and valuable transferable skills.

The principal notes frequent absences (7 so far in the last 4 months, no doctor notes), missed meetings, absence at Parent-Teacher Night even though Fellow was the one who asked about teachers being present for the event (principal said it was required), and Fellow not following through on school-wide procedures like dismissals.

Last January, I taught again for the first time in six years and it reinvigorated me. I learned that the classroom is a place I feel passionate about my work. There is no substitute for the interactions and bonds made when helping and teaching students overcome obstacles. 

I am a stronger candidate for having gone through that, and recognizing my passion through a new-yet-familiar experience. The first half of 2015 was filled with tribulations for me, as my grandfathers health deteriorated in the late winter and spring. He passed away April 29, all the while I was working full time and teaching my class one day a week. 

The months leading up to his passing were not easy, but I learned a lot about myself in that time and what I want to do. That starts with reapplying to the Fellows program.

Children in these neighborhoods are faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Low-income communities are plagued with the daily threat of violence, poor healthcare, along with drug and alcohol abuse. When a connection is made in the classroom it can cause a paradigm shift in students way of thinking about education and their future. I understand the responsibility that comes with teaching and the very real impact I can have on students life.  I cherish this opportunity because it provides the platform for tangible change.

1) My wife teaches in some of New York's low-income communities and is behind my decision to teach in New York, hence my reapplication. 

2) New York needs science and math teachers.

3) While I lived in Colorado I tutored one of relatives' children and helped them  with their homework assignments. I did this throughout the school year. And I loved it. 

4) I have developed interest in STEM (Science; Technology; Engineering; Mathematics) research and pedagogy.  I have numerous credits in science, engineering (M.Sc) and mathematics (B.Sc.).

5) I want to be part of the solution when it comes to improving the quality of education in New York's low-income communities.

6) My wife is taking a master's in education and by helping her with some of her homework, I am finally able to acquaint myself with pedagogical theories and other pedagogical ideas. I have since developed a likeness for teaching.

7) Make a difference in people's lives.

8) I want to change the perception that children from low-income communities cannot successfully compete with their counterparts from wealthy communities.

9) Family-friendly schedule

10)  Improve myself/continuous learning

11) Inspire low-income community students to greater heights

12) Serve as a positive role to students from low-income communities

13) I want to address inequalities in education

14) Teaching is a manageable job

15) Make a change

16) Teaching children

I believe I am a stronger candidates because I have gone back to school to upgrade my knowledge in the areas of science and mathematics (plus liberal arts/humanities/social science). In other words I have since acquired more knowledge and education for the task ahead. My wife's pedagogical  involvement  with children in low-income and her pursuit of a master's in education have enriched my understanding of teaching, something I did not have when I first applied. And like I said elsewhere, I have written at least 200 papers for various online portals covering topics as diverse as education (pedagogy), STEM, culture, race and human relations, economics, sociology, politics, research methodology, history, linguistics, biographical reviews, comparative religion, policy questions, international relations, etc., and all these position me well.

I let him know that I was happy to answer questions, but that the decision had been carefully considered by a team of people and there is no appeals process.

He asked a couple of questions about how his overall score is calculated, so I shared his final average scores, explained how to calculate the overall score, and referred him to the appropriate pages of the PST handbook where this is explained.

He also mentioned that he didn't realize he was struggling as much as he was, since his Coach gave him positive feedback on his improvement in classroom management, so we discussed his PIP and how that was a strong indication that he needed to improve in his classroom observations.

He is interested in pursuing another pathway to teaching, so we discussed why he is not eligible for the NYCTC, the fact that any future coursework at Relay won't be covered by NYCTF, and how to use the Spark Opportunity website to explore other pathways to teaching. He asked about teaching on a long-term sub license in the fall, and i explained that that's only an option for Fellows who are currently enrolled in the program. 

He asked if he could speak to his principal about teachign in the fall, and I explained that he will need to be certified or on a Trans B to teach in the fall so this wouldn't be possible. ",Pre-Service Training,Security Clearance/OPI,"Hi Meha, Dana, and Marie, 

Wanted to give you both a heads up that Richard Hundertmark came in this morning to get fingerprinted and had a question re: whether he can update his background questionnaire or not (its already submitted). He cannot update his BQ once its submitted, and so may trigger a deeper look by OPI if a flag is triggered. If it leads into an investigation, he should be contacted by OPI. 

Please note that Galaxy is not accessible until May 9th (system updates, I believe. Probably for end of fiscal year.) so if he does end up getting investigated, he wont be able to receive his background check clearance notice until after May 9th. 

Ive reached out to OPI to flag this Fellow, and with some clarifying questions. Ill share any updates if information is different from what I shared above. 

Thanks!

  I spoke with Owen Chambers this afternoon and let him know that he could not come back as of today - that today was his final day with us due to his not being granted clearance through OPI. From conversation with him, it is likely he will be visiting the Fellows Office tomorrow to see about his next steps.

  I also spoke with Bernard this afternoon and he advised me that they will create a bulk job to pay Mr. Chambers for the time he was here with us. Copies of the time cards have been sent to Bernard. 

  Thank you for having the NYCTF office send along resumes. The teachers and I will be working on this ASAP.

Hi Anthony,

Glad you called me and we had a chance to touch base about Owen Chambers. It turns out theres an explanation for his nomination disappearance from your T.O. His OPI investigation closed as of yesterday and he was not granted security clearance. He will be receiving a notification via snail mail so he wont receive the official notice of his status for another few days. 

Anthony, how would you like to proceed? Does it make sense to wait until the letter reaches him? The Fellows program will wait to officially withdraw him until we collectively figure out you want to proceed?

Additionally, since hes was in the classroom before he finalized onto payroll, he wont get an official paycheck. Bernard/Karen, how should we proceed with the payment piece? 

In the meantime, as promised, I will connect you with my colleagues overseeing the Fellows Resume book so you can start sourcing new candidates to fill the vacancy. 

Best,

Hi Nuree,
Yes, it is still active.  We had spoken previously to Bernard Palmer about this one as well.  

This is the last thing we told him:

Mr. Owens did meet with our investigator.  Generally, we tell the applicants that it can take up to 10 days for the summary and determination.  If an applicant was denied security clearance, a Final Determination Letter would be mailed directly to the applicant.  

We expect the case to resolve before the week ends.

Hi there!
Hes scheduled to meet with the investigator next Tuesday.  This office received his recent nomination in October.  The amount of time that has elapsed is not indicative of the issue that gave rise to the investigation.  Sometimes outside sources just slow the process.  This office has not made a determination as to security clearance at this time.

That being said, should the school independently determine that they no longer want to proceed with this nomination and rescind the conditional offer of employment, please let us know.

I hope youre well! Im writing to check on a Teaching Fellow. He was nominated at the end of September but hasnt yet finalized. Hes still at step 3 and hasnt moved since. Is this because of a current open investigation or a tech glitch? 

Also, Id like you to know that the principal is having second thoughts about having this Teaching Fellow on his payroll and theres possibility that the school may cancel the nomination altogether but the principal did note that not finalizing yet is one of his concerns. 

Thank you for your guidance with this issue!
Best,
Nuree

However, we relied on our ingenuity, determination, and team-work to bring the best of ourselves to achieve the best in our students. We utilized the resources available to create activities that were part of the lesson plan and still met the academic standards. The students were able to graduate and continue their successful path towards kindergarten. The sense of accomplishment I felt at the end of the year is indescribable. I witnessed and experienced the different types of struggles that characterizes low income schools and its population.

My application reflected this.

Over the past year, I have given much thought to determine the next step in my career. I found out that a dear friends sister is a Fellow. She teaches 7th grade special education at PS 687 and is aunt to a child with special needs. I have observed her classroom and we have had extensive discussions about the challenges her students face coming from an underserved community, and the skills and techniques she has learned through the Fellows, mentors, and colleagues.
  
Every single one of her students has been personally affected by gun violence. This reminded me of my days as a substitute teacher at the High School for Graphic Communication Arts. I was teaching mathematics to a vulnerable student population with no training and no textbooks. I supplied pencils and paper. As much as I loved working at HSGCA I wish I had the tool box of skills the Fellows provides. I would have been a far more effective teacher. 

The former head of high school of my alma mater, who retired last year as principal of the George Jackson Academy, a school that attracts its student population from low-income families, suggested the New York City Teaching Fellows as a pathway I would be interested in. He is familiar with my work, professional and volunteer, and of my interest to continue to work with low income, at-risk youth. 

The average IQ for students at GJA is 131. GJA has provided some incredible opportunities for a minuscule fraction of New York Citys at-risk students. This brings up a very important question - have we given up on the students with average IQs? What about those with special needs? No, I havent, and neither have the members of the Teaching Fellows.

Here I find myself mid-career and I aspire to do something meaningful that goes further than volunteer work. I truly believe that the Teaching Fellows is the right place for me to pursue my dreams and benefit the future of New York Citys student population, our future.

I know that you are working hard to provide creative instructional experiences for students. However, please be mindful of all deadlines and dress code expectations.

Lesson plans for Monday and Tuesday were due yesterday (Friday, July 29, 2016). Your lesson plans were not submitted until 1:18 this afternoon (Saturday, July 30, 2016). 

Please keep in mind that the dress code is business casual. You were observed wearing flip flops and jeans on Thursday. This does not comply with Teaching Fellows dress code.

Thank you for your time and attention to these matters.

",Professionalism,Attendance,"Hi Melissa, 

Thank you for sending this over! To confirm, you will not have to attend the Autism training tomorrow, June 17th. 

Additionally, given the information you shared about the accommodations needed to take your ALST, we will not count June 23rd as an absence. Please let your lead instructor know that you will be missing that day of training -- you will receive more information about your lead instructor and skill-building sessions very soon. Note that you may still receive a message through TeacherTrack about your attendance that day, but we have added a note to your file with the context you provided.

In the meantime, keep us updated about how Pearson schedules your CST. As much as you can, please advocate for scheduling your CST on a weekend as every day of PST is critical.

Let me know if you have questions in the meantime. See you at the Welcoming Event!

Best,

I am better candidate now because of one word: wisdom.

For the past three years I have worked in a high-needs school in Jamaica, Queens, as a paraprofessional. I'm a different person because of people like Ms. Rock, a teacher whom I served under. 

When I came to Ms. Rock's class every day to work, I knew that she would not  tolerate a lackadaisical effort. I thought of this when I ran the hills in Forest Park before work. There's no ""B"" game when you serve in her class. Now, I shoot for peak performance every day.

I'm a better candidate because during the summer of 2013 I did something I was petrified of: I got on a plane to take a trip to El Salvador. Prior to that, I had not taken an out-of-country trip since 2007, to Mexico. I had a nightmare experience on that trip. But I summoned the will to get up that morning and get on that plane. It changed my life. 

Since facing that fear, I have traveled to Peru, Colombia and Mexico many times over. I've enrolled in a Spanish language class, because the whole world speaks at least two languages. I've been robbed at knife point for my phone. I've seen people selling Chiclets on the street in order to eat. I've had people open their homes to me when I was in need. 

When I was in Bacalar, Mexico, in April, I saw a man wandering the streets. He was a young man, perhaps 28 years old, dressed in rags. He motioned with his hands furiously in front of his face.

It struck me that this man was autistic. I watched as he sidled up next to a vendor selling tamales from a stand. He tapped her, lightly, on the back. Then he danced away. He was hungry, but he could not express it.

""Why is that man doing that?,"" I asked a woman on the street.

""Something is wrong with his head,"" she answered in Spanish.

At that moment, I saw the need that Mexico- that the whole world has- in addressing this population.

Subject: Re: Information about your District 75 School Tour on May 31

Good Afternoon Ms. Allison,
Thank you for reaching out to me and introducing yourself as the contact person for the school tour that is scheduled tomorrow. 
After much thought and consideration, I will be withdrawing my application for the 2016 NYC Teaching Fellows Program. I am receiving follow-up medical care after an injury sustained in April. 
I am concerned about not being able to participate in the full training program due to recomended follow-up medical care by my doctor. I was hoping to come to a full recovery by the start of Pre-Service Training, but unfortunately I will be attending twice a week at minimum 6-weeks of physical therapy in attempt to regain full usage of my right shoulder. 
It is with deep regrets that I withdraw my participation in the NYCTF program, including all upcoming scheduled tours. 
Best Regards, 
Barbara Aristide

Subject: NYCTF Eligibility

Hello
 
Ms
. 
Amy Way

, 



Hope all is well
 and a Happy New Year to you
. I'm writing regarding my application to the NYCTF. I applied to the teaching fellows earlier 
in 2015
 and was successful through
out the process
except the last 
stage

when I received notice of my rejection into the program. I was immensely disappointed and discouraged and even took the liberty to seek you out and ask for a possible reconsideration to no avail. 

I have since decided to be proactive and take control of my life by pursuing different pathways for my passion to become an educator. I provided this information in my recent application 
to NYCTF

as suggested and spoken by other fellows, in hopes it would strengthen my candidacy. 

The results were to my detriment for reasons unclear. I have been communicating with an operations manager who resubmitted my application for consideration after I explained my qualifications based on the NYCTF website. After two weeks of anticipation and no response, I inquired again through the fellows contact form, and was then told my application was pulled without my knowing. The reasons stated 
for pulling my application again 
w
as
the same 
reason 
that 
I
 init
i
ally addressed
 and was told I would be considered.
 
I
t
 is 
unclear 
to me 
why I've made a circle on the
 same
issue
 after being assured
. 
The reason stated was having education credits.
 While 
I completely understand that I would not be able to pursue a 
degree

 program and the NYCTF program simultaneously
,
 
having education credits 
does not make me an illegible 
candidate and is not prohibited by NYCTF 
so long as I have not completed a teaching preparatory program, do not hold a license 
to teach 
and have no
 teaching experience.
 If I were to change majors I would still be in the same predicament as having education credits and still would have not completed a teaching preparatory program. 

This would make me or anyone with education credits ineligible.
 

In my last inquiry I asked if I could submit a more tailored resume as it seem to be the issue or if my concern can be escalated to which I have not received a reply.Below is a copy of my last response which was not addressed. NYCTF asks for people who has a dedication to teaching, and this is my second application within the calendar year and with education credits that I chose to disclose to highlight my 
strong
interest. It's not unheard-of for prospective fellows to take steps that would be more advantageous in their candidacy or for their personal life. On the NYCTF Live Journals page, a recently accepted fellow stated she was also rejected this year but reapplied with education credits. I have answered the application questions and followed the rules outlined to be considered as an eligible candidate for this program and would greatly appreciate your help in addressing my concerns. 


Respectfully,
Mischka


""...Again, I'm confused. There's no where on the NYCTF website that states you can not be enrolled in an education degree program. 
However, what It does state is that you can not have completed a preparatory teaching program which I have not. 

 You stated the following...

"" When I took a look at your resume, I thought you were obtaining your master's degree in Art Education, which is a degree title that is accepted by our program so long as you are not receiving your teaching license. Under this assumption, I reopened your application for consideration"" - This is true. 

Again since our last communication, I have stated I will not complete a teacher preparatory program before the summer 2016 which is a requirement for the NYCTF. 
I have been waiting the past couple of weeks for the next step with my application completely unaware it was pulled from consideration. 
I would like to ask if I can  resubmit a more tailored resume? Or can my inquiry be escalated? 
Based on the information provided on the website and questions on the application page, I am an eligible candidate unless I have taught, hold a teaching license, or completed an education degree. program.""

Hi Carly, 

I was having trouble finding the origina",Withdrawal,Follow-up to outplacement convo from TAD,"Hi Carly,


I'd be happy to provide some context for that conversation. A coach did accidentally reply all to an email that Chad was on.  He had given her a great deal of push-back during her feedback conversation, so Sean and I had both stepped in to offer him extra support and feedback on his lessons.  Melissa (his swap coach), his home coach (Nicole), and I all sat down and discussed the email and Melissa apologized for anything that made him feel uncomfortable and explained that she just wanted him to receive feedback in a way that helped him grow. He then said that he thought we all had been talking about him, since he had mentioned to me that the train stop we take (in Harlem) was dangerous sometimes, but she told him that he had also told her that during their debrief conversation. He said that wasn't true, and she repeated some details about what block he lives on and a conversation they had about a park in Harlem, which he never had with any of the other staff, myself included.  He then said he felt like the email indicated that he was being targeted and that it was decided that he would be kicked out of the program already, and I explained that wasn't the case at all. That while that email was not intended to be sent to him and we were all sorry for any discomfort it caused, the point of it is that we wanted to find the best and most effective ways to support him and his development throughout the Summer. I then reiterated that we as staff do not decide to kick people out and reexplained how the process of evaluation works.  He said he understood and we talked about additional ways that Sean and I could support him (we both did extra reviews of his lesson plans before and after that email incident, did extra informal obs, etc.).

Chad also repeatedly said that Nicole did not provide him with Feedback the first week on his lesson plans, though she shared it with him in google docs. He did not tell her for several days that he was unable to find the feedback. Once he did bring it to her attention, she began emailing him his feedback directly, rather than putting it in google docs, to accommodate his difficulties with locating the feedback.  She spent several extra hours over the course of the summer revising his lesson plans with him and giving him explicit teaching suggestions--many more hours than she was required to and certainly more than some of her other Fellows received.  Sean and I spent extra time supporting him as well.

I'm happy to give any additional information that you need--just let me know.
Thanks and talk to you soon!

Hi Lily, 
Hope youre doing well and enjoying your August now that PST is over. 
 
Im writing to follow up on a situation that has come to our attention about Chad Menville. As you know, Chad was in the consider evidence category and based on his performance and other evidence over the course of his time with NYCTF, he was removed from the program yesterday. 
 
Chad came in today to discuss his situation with someone on our staff and he mentioned that at times this summer he felt targeted by coaches at his training academy. He pulled up and read aloud an email that was between two coaches and was about him and not meant for him from July 21st (it sounded like it had been an email between two coaches that he was accidentally CCed on). 
 
I know that often Fellows get upset in these types of conversations, but I wanted to follow up to see if you had any context (or access to) the email Chad is referring to or if anything had come to your attention over the course of the summer between Chad and his coaches that would be helpful for us to know as we want to ensure we have a full record of everything that occurred. 
 
Thanks so much for your help with this Lily. Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best,
Carly

",Withdrawal,Outplacement Conversation,Shauna and I (Lauren) spoke with Chad about his outplacement. He explained that he felt like the coaches had an issue with him from the beginning because he had wanted his Training Academy changed and that they held this against him. He says Melissa and Shaun had the most issues with him and even sent an email between them that accidentally cc'd him that made fun of him. He referred to the two coaches as abusive. He believed he was on a PIP because the email happened the evening before he was issued a PIP. Shauna explained that the decisions were not personal and that he his performance and scores indicated that he needed additional support. She also emphasized that he was outplaced because of his performance and that we used multiple measures and perspectives from NYCTF staff to make a decision. He seemed to take it all extremely personally and ranted about the coaches.,Withdrawal,outplacement,"Chad called on 8/17 after receiving a message regarding his outplacement. He asked to speak to Amy Way and I explained while this is not a possibility, he can speak to one of our staff members. He said that would be fine. He then explained that he felt he was treated unfairly by the coaches. He stated that he thought they had a personal problem with him from the start of training because he requested to change his TA. He also stated that he was accidentally copied on an email where multiple coaches were making fun of him. He stated multiple situations where he felt personally alienated by coaches, and feels that these personal issues led to his low scores. I explained that candidates are reviewed holistically and explained what that meant. I then reiterated that he would be able to speak to a staff member and scheduled the appointment. ",Withdrawal,,,

My selection day experience is what motivated me to reapply. I came out of my interview with so much enthusiasm and energy that I knew it was the right program for me. 

What I didnt expect was how much of an impact fellow candidates would have on my impression of the program. Through my informal conversations with other applicants, I consistently heard that everyone was there for the right reason: Because they wanted to make a difference and believed that every student is entitled to an excellent education. I didnt get the sense that anyone was just looking for a nice addition to their resume. I knew that I could grow alongside people like this and be inspired by their examples during training.

The other aspect that impressed me during my selection day was how much I learned. I appreciated that during each lesson the interviewers provided real-life examples of why it was important and how our students would likely receive our instructions and lessons. I was confident that if chosen, I would receive the proper, hands-on training I needed to be successful in the classroom. 

This six-month time period has helped me assess what I want from a teaching program and the kind of teacher I want to be. I am even more certain now that the New York City Teaching Fellows is aligned with my teaching goals and aspirations.

It has given me time to reflect further on myself and the world around me. Ive had some really tough days as well as some really great days. I enjoy every second of it because my passion and drive run deep within me. It is personal. Education inequity is not just a problem for me and you, but it is everyones problem. It is one thing to simply notice the inequities of education and another to proactively transform it. 
I have grown (and will continue to grow) in my abilities to teach and learn, and to interact and engage with others. Throughout all of my experiences, I have had the opportunity to observe and practice diverse classroom styles and pedagogy. I feel prepared and eager to continue my journey. I want to discover the hidden potentials of students, teachers, families, and communities because I believe in the principle that says, It takes a village to raise a child. Collectively, we must question, explore, reinvent, and test alternate, creative ways to build knowledge constantly, relentlessly, and keenly.  
I am brought to this work because I feel that the state of the world is in need. The world needs a hug (in both the literal and figurative sense). This work is personal and important to me because the present and future depend on real, genuine persons, real passion and feeling, real progress, real love, real relationships and unity, real critique and real action! It is far too necessary and serious for me to conceive it any other way. If I can positively influence students in any way that pushes them one step closer to success, it makes all the difference in the world.

Hi Heberto,

Thanks for reaching out with this question! The best thing to do in this situation is inform your Training Academy Director and direct the Fellow to call the NYCTF office. Her email to you was a bit stern, bordering on unprofessional, so it probably warrants a Level 1 FYI. That way, our team is looped in on whats happening.

I hope your first week of SBS went well! I love your practice of having Fellows present slides and certain infothe more practice they get speaking in front of others, the better. ?

Hey Laura & Alyssa,
I hope your week is coming to a close nicely. I received an email from one of my Fellows from the first two weeks of PST, and she requested that I change attendance due to her standing in the program. I wondered if I should respond or what my next steps should be. I have included Henry, one of the coaches from those weeks, as well as the thread from the her initial email. Thank you and have a great week.

Hey Henry,
I hope all is well and going smoothly at your new site. Yes, I agree, she did come to check in but then did miss the majority of class. If a Fellow is out of SBS for >20min then they are considered absent. Furthermore, she did not complete any of the work that day, too. Therefore, in my professional opinion she was absent. Did you follow up with her? Let me know and have a great weekend.

Hey Heberto,

Hope Field Experience is going well broski. Below is my statement of what happened that day just for your information.

I think this was the day when Janay got upset, rightfully so, about not receiving a check. I remember Janay showing up early but left before coming back at around 5PM. Another note, I saw her chatting on the phone as I came back from the bathroom before she showed up in class.

So although she did come early, Janay did miss about half an hour's worth of SBS without notifying any of us about where she was going or doing.

Best,
Henry

Hello Fellas,
I am writing because Teaching Fellows is threatening to kick me out of the program due to my tardiness or equivalent absences. On Teacher Track under Groups it says that I was tardy to skill building on June 24th and July 1st.
I believe that I was marked tardy in error. The date in question is July 1st. I was on time. I arrived well before 4:30pm at which I spoke to Henry first, then Heberto about my missing check (which I did receive finally). 
Please fix this error as my standing in the program is at stake. 
Thanks.

",Professionalism,Attendance call,"I called Janay because she has been tardy multiple times (Tardy 3 times: on 7/01 for 20 min, on 7/05 for 26 min, and on 6/24 for 3 min. Received a threshold message on 7/06. Also 11 minutes late today). She was resistant and expressed that one of the lates (7/1) was an error. It is FYI'd on that day saying that she was upset that she didn't receive her stipend check and therefore missed 20 minutes of SBS. I reiterated this to her, explaining that any time outside of class is considered missed time - regardless of whether it was at the beginning or end of the session - and she still expressed that she wasn't gone for 20 minutes and it was an error. I reminded her that she needs to be present for the remainder of PST and she said she understood and would be present moving forward.",Pre-Service Training,,,,,,,,,

A person really shouldn't spend his whole working life squeezing profits out of financial markets. I believe this is an appropriate time for me to make a change in career path. Unfortunately, since there is no feedback in the NYC Teaching Fellows program application process, it's difficult to guess what was lacking in a previous application. Since I was ""knocked out"" at the phone interview stage, I assume that failed on some aspect of the questioning there. Judging from the tone of the questions, it seems one is supposed to answer that it is possible (or even to be expected) that a new teacher would have a 100% success rate in achieving academic excellence in a typical NYC classroom. In the rapid-fire pace of a phone interview, perhaps I was unable to make clear the distinction that I was trying to emphasize: while each individual student has the potential for achieving academic excellence, one should not be unaware of the statistical unlikelihood of realizing that potential in every student in a large class. While a 100% success rate with a large group of students is, of course, the aspiration of every teacher, in everyday life it is more likely a red flag for cheating than an outcome of hard work.

These major factors are:  
1) My love for kids,
2) My love for teaching, and
3) My strong belief, that thru education all things are possible and all students can perform at a high level no matter what their circumstances are if they are given the love, dedication, resource, and tools needed to succeed.
I love working with kids because their personalities are so colorful and they arent afraid of anything.  They also have a different outlook on the world than adults and I love seeing the world thru their eyes.  My love for teaching started when I began tutoring class-mates after-school.  I enjoyed helping them better understand the course work and get better grades.
When I graduated from college and became a restaurant manager I found a lot of joy in training and developing my employees who were interested in getting promoted and becoming managers.  When I worked at Starbucks Coffee company management candidates would request to train with me because they knew they would get the best training from a manager who would give them her all, who was organized, who knew how to give feedback and knew how to teach someone at their level.  
It had always been a dream of mine to open a daycare center.  This dream became a reality in 2009.  This experience further solidified my love for children, my love for teaching and my belief that thru education all things are possible and all students can perform at a high level no matter what their circumstances are if they are given the love, encouragement and tools they need to succeed.
All of my students in my daycare came from a low-income community.  I was faced with the challenges of poor student attendance, students coming to daycare hungry, parents not being able to consistently pay for daycare or pay on-time.  I also had children in my daycare with special needs.  I fought thru all of these challenges.  How?  My students who didnt attend school on a regular basis I sat with their parents every chance I had to instill in them the importance of their child coming to school on a consistent basis.  Poor attendance equals poor academics, their child falling behind.  Students who are constantly absent tend to have lower math and reading abilities.  Students who came to daycare hungry I fed them, no questions asked.  I pointed their parents in the direction of government assistance, or any other programs I could think of that could help them.  Parents who had a hard time paying for daycare I kept their kids for free because I didnt want their child to fall behind in their learning and development.  I also assisted these parents with getting child care vouchers or I negotiated a fee they could afford.  I did not want their child to be left behind.
I also had children in my daycare with various disabilities.  I worked with their parents and specialists to help ensure their growth and development.  I did all of these things because my desire for children to succeed no matter what is unwavering.  Even though I no longer operate my daycare my parents still keep in contact with me to let me know how their kids are doing and it makes me proud.  So these are the reasons why I decided to re-apply to the Teaching Fellows Program.

Specifically, he was concerned that he is under review as he did not receive notification that he would not pass PST until the last day of training. He stated that he was never on a PIP and therefore did not have the opportunity to improve. He asked about the review process, and I explained that we review candidates holistically, and referred him to his PST Handbook. He said that he had a job lined up, and had several questions regarding his ability to accept that job, or participate in a different alternative certification program, which I answered. We ended the conversation confirming that he will receive notification of his status no later than August 22.

During the conversation, Anand was professional, but was visibly nervous regarding his status.",Pre-Service Training,Consider Evidence - TAD context,"Laura:

We had a bit of a weird situation yesterday.  There was a Fellow - Anand Vyas - who statistically speaking flew right above the PIP line all summer long, so he never was sort of ""flagged"" by our staff as a Fellow of serious concern that would have required any sort of extra formal intervention.  He struggled on his last two observations, and it hurt him enough where he may have fallen below the 2.2 threshhold, to which ""additional evidence"" is considered.  Moreover, the coach did not recommend him for completion of PST when she logged the last observation into TT2.

It was sort of a perfect storm...he was never really given any feedback that his completion of the program was in jeopardy, until he sort of bombed the last observation - after which the coach also decided to not recommend him for a position this fall.  I had a conversation with him on Friday (the last day, of all days), and tasked him with calculating his own overall PST score using the math from the handbook.  I also told him that if he falls between 1.9 and 2.2, he'll have to have additional evidence considered, after which an overall decision will be made.  He understood the ramifications and the next steps.

I've also tasked the coach (Shinair Francis) with formally compiling all the evidence that led her to that decision (late lesson plan emails, conversations, instances where he didn't implement feedback) so that she can share it all with me.  

In my honest opinion, Anand was not given ample notice to really make adjustments.  With a decision of this magnitude, you'd like to have a paper trail of evidence so that the Fellow in question knew all along that things were not going well, so that he/she could have attempted adjustments before it came to this.  Blame for that can fall on my shoulders, and also on the fact that he was close to the PIP line, but never under it.  What would you like me to do?  Can I be in the loop once all the evidence is gathered and considered?  it may be moot - he may have done well enough on Technique Assessments/Anchor Technique Assessments to cover up the one low observation towards the end - but I'm not sure.  

Again, let me know.

",Pre-Service Training,University Transfer ,"Anand was moved from Hunter to Relay as he did not meet the admissions requirements for Hunter College. Dana called him to inform him and he sent the following message in the Contact Form. I then called him to follow up to close the loop as it was already Thursday and he needed to enroll at Relay. He did  not understand why he was being moved and said he was not given any information. I walked him through the fact that he had not met Hunter's internal requirements and because we needed him to be enrolled at a program we had transferred his university. He asked if there was an option to appeal and whether he could be moved back. I walked him through why it would not be possible for him to attend Hunter and that Relay was the best fit given his commute. He asked if he could be placed at SJU and I explained that we did not have a SpEd 7-12 cohort at SJU.
He was calm and professional throughout but was really pushing back. 

Hi Anand, 

Thank you for reaching out to us  and we do understand the accelerated nature of your enrollment process at Relay GSE.

Please note that this transfer was necessary because Hunter deemed you ineligible for their program. Our university partners do have internal requirements, and upon closer look at your coursework, Hunter will not be able to accept you as a candidate in their program because you do not meet their specific liberal arts requirements. 

As a result, we have accommodated a switch to Relay GSE. They are aware of your situation  and will work with you to make sure you are able to enroll into their program for your Masters degree. 

Best, 
Dana

Alex was professional during the conversation and expressed confusion about his final score and outplacement decision. While Alex said he calculated his score he was very close to a 2.2, his score ended up as a 2.06. We talked about the different measures we take into account and how that score is determined. He asked to see the comments his Coach and TAD shared but I explained this was shared in confidence but we could send his scores to him in an email. Alex expressed that he did not understand this and hoped that meeting would shed light on what went into his decision. I shared that was what I was hoping to do but that there is some information that we are not able to share. Alex asked about what I had in front of me and I shared that I was looking at essentially a summary of all of the information that went into his decision. He shared that he would like to see that as well and I explained that I wasn't able to share that as it included some of the confidential feedback shared by his NYCTF staff. Alex left still expressing some confusion. While I made clear this was an issue of him not meeting the performance bar, I think he left hoping to learn things that we simply don't share with Fellows. I did my best to be clear about this but I got the impression Alex may have felt as though information was being withheld even with my explanations of what we shared and ensuring that his scores were sent to him over email.

Dear Alex,

I am concerned that you did not submit your first lesson plan to me on time. I am aware that I told you 5pm today, and that coach Riyad sent out a different email earlier stating that the due date for tomorrow/Friday's lesson plan was by noon today. Either way, I have not yet received a lesson plan from you.

I wanted to take a moment to kindly remind you that NYCTF deadlines for Academy lesson plans are mandatory for all Fellows and that you must follow them. We did our best to make these expectations very clear at Academy training on Tuesday. In addition, there have been emails sent to all Fellows in our academy on two different threads, one started by Sharon and one started by Riyad, that state the deadlines and have materials attached if need be. Make sure to send me your lesson plan as soon as possible. I cannot ensure that I will be able to give you feedback in time for classes tomorrow since I have not yet received your lesson plan.

Please reach out if you have difficulty accessing any of these materials, and make sure to meet your deadlines.

Thank you,
Zoe",Missed Deadline,,,,,,,,,

Hello Dana,

Let me begin by saying, I had no intention of resigning from the program nor did I ever want to resign from the school, but I had to what I thought was best for me, and more importantly, the students.

Just to inform, and maybe give a little understanding, the school placed me with three subjects. Three of my of my classes were ICT classes of 30 students and I did not have a special Ed teacher in the room with me. All of my three geometry classes were seniors who had already passed geometry, but had not passes the reagents. Needless to say, the students were shut down before I could even try. I could not get a handle on any of these classes as I had no maps or direction on where to begin with lessons. The dean and AP came in to one of my classes and gave them a ""talking to,"" but to no avail, and possibly made it worse as students started throwing papers at me as soon as they left. 

Was it unprofessional to resign on a whim? Yes, but my hope is that the school would take a better look at these classes and see how affected the students learning was. All I want is to be a teacher, and a great one at that. I was so honored to be a part of the fellowship and worked so hard at setting myself up for success, but if I had stayed at that school for another day, I know all that passion would have been gone before I could develop into the teacher I know I can be.

I'm not sure if asking for a chance to find another school in January, and stay with the fellowship is even an option. If there is a way to appeal. It breaks my heart to think that I failed, but it's not a decision I took lightly. Just know I was failing the students by being there more than leaving. 

Either way, Dana, I greatly appreciate you taking the time to read this email and hope to hear from you.

Regards,

After failed attempts at trying to reach Nia regarding registering for classes, they could no longer wait due to her being out of compliance with their school policies. I have asked the University to forward me the dismissal email after it has been sent to Nia.

The email read:
Hi Charlene,

Just to add clarification regarding Nia Owens. Our decision is due to a number of reasons:

1. Student has not responded to our correspondence and has not contacted us in nearly a month
2. Student has not registered for any courses for the Fall 2016 semester. The Registration Appeal process for late registration has now officially passed
3. Student does not possess a Trans B certification
4. Although deadline has not passed, student has not found a school placement

We will be reaching out to our School of Education to place a hold on the student's account so that she will not be able to register without specific approval. We will contact you if there are any updates regarding her status here at Hunter College.

Can you send me the adjustment you would like me to make to my lesson plan by 8 o'clock so I can make those changes.

Thank you

Subject: Re: Lesson Plan for Wednesday 

There is no way that you can have the same book and same questions over two days. No excuses. You have until midnight to fix it. 
Thank you

My email last week read:

Hi, you two have been a great team so far. But just a heads up that you need to be teaching separate lessons and submitting separate lesson plans (and you are the one who uploads it). 

Your lessons will likely be in conjunction with each other but the state standards, aim, and assessment will all be different. FOR EXAMPLE: Moriam reads the first half of a book and has students answering questions and making inferences - leading them towards explaining the book's theme (which is her assessment) while Thomas supports (45min); Thomas reads the second half of the book (and on a different worksheet) has students citing textual evidence to form an opinion based on the theme. His assessment is based on the opinion & ability to cite text; while Moriam supports (45min).

Dear Moriam, 
I noticed that your Wednesday lesson is the same as Thomas' Tuesday lesson. All that you changed was the aim and standards. This is not acceptable - and I thought that we had cleared up the confusion last week. I would like to have you create your own lesson (based on the same book if you like - that is fine) by midnight tonight. I look forward to reading it. 
Regards,
kees

Hi Felicia and Sue, 

Hope all is well. Ive spoken with Yvonne Rodriguez and clarified that Lehmans individual Trans B program state-approved and valid so David Leiderman is staffable at the DOE. Shes ok with that given that Trans Bs hire-ability is something that she defers to TRQ for. 

I have spoken with Principal Nalini Singh, to whom I advised that she wait until he finalizes on payroll (walked her through the Details page in Galaxy for David Leiderman) to inform him that he can report to school. 

Sue  while David Leiderman is no longer a Fellow, he is enrolled in a valid independent Trans B program at Lehman. Please unblock his cert in NYCAPS so he can move towards finalizing on payroll. 

Thank you!

I wrote to Yvonne separately asking why its not acceptable when Relay has the same thing. I purposely emailed her directly to confirm without you or anyone else on it. Shell probably want to get on the phone to discuss with me.

Hi Nalini,

According to the Director of the Office of Certification & Licensing, this is not sufficient. They do not accept the Trans B unless the teacher is part of Teaching Fellows or Teach for America programs.

I'm working with a teacher at Nalini Singh's school x376. David Leiderman is slotted to teach science but his Trans B  -- from the Lehman Trans B -- isn't in the system. I said I would follow up with you.

Any updates you have would be appreciated.

",None,attendance follow-up,"We emailed  David on 7/27 requesting that he submit a doctors note for his absence on 7/26 in order to remain eligible in the program. He responded via email on 7/27:

""Hi Heather,
Thank you very much for getting back to me, and for your thoughtful message! I really appreciate it. I'm excited to finish the program strong!
Attached please find my doctors note for 7/26/16. As lousy as I still felt today, I powered through as I love this program and can't wait to teach in the fall. 
Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do. I'm grateful for this opportunity.
Best regards,
David""

The attached doctor's note from Dr. Robert Grossman stated that the physician requested that David have an appointment with him due to an urgent medical issue, and should be medically excused for 7/26. I responded to David via email on 7/28 stating that he can remain in the program but any additional tardies/absences will result in removal from the program.",Pre-Service Training,email on attendance,"David wrote in on 7/26:

""I have had a prior absence, and then a lateness and left for a doctors appointment during the day. Those are noted in my account. I'm incredibly ill today. I can't get dismissed from the program. This is my life's calling and I already have a job. Please, I will bring a doctors note tomorrow. 
I have to apologize profusely. I have something called cluster headaches, which I was diagnosed with years ago. I started to have symptoms again last week. They manifest like a cold, and then hit like a jackhammer in the back of my eye. Last night I took medication and was managing this morning. Then like a drill was placed inside my brain I got one of the worst headaches of my life. When I take my medication, it drops me like a fly for hours. I'm going to the doctor at 2 pm today, but I'm knocked down for the day. Please give me this chance. This was beyond unpredictable and I'm truly sorry. Thank you very much for understanding.""",Pre-Service Training,Call about 3 absences,"I called David to speak to him about his 3 absences (two absences and 22 min late). He disputed the absences, saying that he was only 15 minutes late but that there was a security sign-in at the building before the sign-in in the library. He also disputed the second absence saying that he was there but was out at a doctor's appointment for an hour and a half and only missed part of his planning time.  He also felt targeted, like he was just getting caught, while other people were doing the same thing and were not getting caught. He also felt like his coach was trying to push him out of the program. I encouraged him to speak to his TAD or other staff in the building for additional support and to discuss the absences with his coach or TAD. I also reminded him of our policies and shared that moving forward he really needs to focus on attendance. He asked if he was being kicked out and I said no but he has to be present moving forward. He was upset, but not rude, throughout the call.  ",Pre-Service Training,,,

I truly regret having to do this, but Im dropping out of the program. I understand how serious this is but much of the program has not been what I expected. The combination of the work load and travel makes it very difficult to get done what is required especially with instructions coming so last minute. Honestly, it a lot of difficulties that have piled up and I dont feel like I have been prepared to take sole responsibility for a class, nor do I feel comfortable using summer school to learn while teaching without another fully qualified co-teacher. 

I am truly sorry but I dont think I can be an effective teacher in the school system at this time. Please let me know what the protocol is when someone drops out so I can get it done. If necessary, I can be prepared to teach on Monday since it is short notice.

Hi Kristofer,

Thank you for reaching out to us and for coming by the office. 

Thank you for sharing your concern around the error on your Professional Traits Concern Letter with not submitting lesson plans in a timely manner. Please know that we have already corrected your PCL shortly after it was issued to reflect the correct reasons for why you were given a PCL, which omits the lesson planning deadline error. 

Therefore, this instance is not taken into consideration when deciding on your final status in the program.

Message from Kristofer:

I would like to come into the office tomorrow to advocate for myself, I already have a job, and I really wouldn't like to let my principal down. I love this profession and want to grow with it. I would like to discuss this in person as it is more human.
",Pre-Service Training,Changes to EPT CL,"I was reading through the issue logs and realized I never logged the phone calls I made to Kristofer after I changed the EPT CL. In the EPT CL conversation I had with Kristofer, he disputed that he missed a deadline. I followed up with his coach and realized I made an error in misinterpreting the FYI. I asked his coach to edit the FYI to reflect what happened and I updated his EPT CL to reflect this conversation. I tried to call Kristofer to discuss, but we kept playing phone tag. I left a message explaining that I had made the change in his account and he could view the revised letter. He called back and left another message to say he had got the message. I think this was on the last day of PST, so I left it at that. ",Professionalism,Coach emails surrounding EPT CL,"Lauren

Would you be able to edit the FYI and add a paragraph at the bottom that explains that your concern is that despite multiple emails and reminders, he still asked for an exemption? And would you be able to indicate that he did turn in the lesson plan on time, if this was actually the case? 

If he asks about this, you can tell him you spoke to me to clear things up and if he wants to reach out to me, he can feel free to do so.

Subject: Re: EPT CL - Kristofer Lorusso

Hi Lauren,

He sent that email after multiple reminders in writing and in person that my fellows should check in with collaborating teachers on Thursday in order to meet the Monday deadline.  After I told him I would not review late lesson plans, he submitted them on time.  That's why it was logged at a level 1.  The initial email was a little shocking based on my many reminders.  

Thanks for the follow up,
Lauren

Quick question. Kris also disputed that he had missed a deadline. Upon re-reading your FYI, it was unclear to me if he actually missed the deadline or just asked to miss the deadline. Can you let me know which is correct in case I should follow-up and change the EPT CL?  
 
Thanks!

Hi Lauren,

Thanks for reaching out.  I did not have a chance to do the email Kris yet as I was doing the ratings and finishing the lesson plan reviews for the end of the week.  However, he reached out to me first because of the phone call he received.  I was responding as you wrote.  I have posted his email below and I will add my response into TT2.   
 
Thanks again,
Lauren
 
See Kris's email below:
 
I just reviewed a phone call from the teaching fellows addressing issues of professionalism. It talked about the instance that I publicly apologized for and then cited that I missed an assignment July 17th which is not true, and that I missed breakfast today which is true. Janay didn't attend breakfast, and Nora never attends when I go. I will go from now on. However if you are preparing to not recommend me to get my transitional b certificate please let me know rather than have me work and improve towards nothing. I will follow the schedule precisely and continue to improve through the next 2 days, but the teaching fellows calling me tonight was extremely discouraging. Please let me know how to proceed.

Kris

Hi Lauren -
A number of FYIs were submitted for Kristofer, so we issued an Essential Professional Traits Concern Letter today. The specific letter is attached and can also be found in the Fellows TT2 account. I spoke to Kristofer on the phone and answered all questions and communicated clear next steps. Please make sure to continue submitting FYIs if there are any issues or concerns. If Kristofer has any additional questions about the Concern Letter, you can refer the Fellow to me (my information is in the letter). 
Additionally, if you have email communication with the fellow after Level 2s, please be sure to include that in FYIs. All Level 2s should be followed-up with after via email. This is crucial to ensuring that we are able to follow-up appropriately. Please edit any FYIs if you have email communications with the Level 2s. Next time you submit a Level 2 or 3, please be sure to send an email and include the text in the FYI. 
Thanks!

",Professionalism,Issued EPT CL,"I called Kristofer to issue an EPT CL. He was rude throughout the phone call; he interrupted me many times, asked condescending questions, and used a rude tone. 
When I issued next steps, he said, ""You realize that PST is over in a few days?"" He asked if this is a PIP and if we were kicking him out. Then, he said that we must be confusing him with someone else and that this is the third time he's been confused for someone else. I assured him we were referring to issues with him and shared the details and let him know that he needed to follow the next steps. Once I shared more details, he said, okay I did some of that stuff. He said, ""Over the coming two days you mean..okay, three days."" He complained about his coach and feeling ostracized. He said he spoke to his TAD and they addressed the issue of his negative attitude and read a letter aloud to the group, which shamed him. He said he has called teaching fellows and ""you do not answer your phones."" He continued to be rude throughout the call and I impressed upon him that he needs to act appropriately moving forward.

As it turned out, I was able to return to New York in short order, and my career took a sudden turn to work on campaigns for LGBT rights here.

Several years later, I returned to school and received an MFA in Creative Writing from Rutgers University. I began teaching writing through the Rutgers Early Access College Humanities program this winter, and have never been more sure that I belong in the classroom. REaCH provides college level, credit-bearing courses to Newark high school students who aspire to be the first in their families to attend college. Teaching them has been a challenge and a pleasure. To put myself through school, I have also been working as an SAT tutor for a very different populationalmost exclusively wealthy families in Westchester and the city. This tutoring experience has provided valuable skills, particularly in teaching writing mechanics, but it simply cannot compare with how rewarding REaCH has been. 

As I reapply to NYCTF this year, I can say with confidence that I want to teach, that I want to teach where Im needed most, and that I can make a real difference in the lives of high-needs students.

Teaching Fellows is a great program that provides those who want be teachers an opportunity and because I wasn't selected last year doesn't mean I am going to stop striving for that opportunity. There are two things that have occurred since I last applied that gives me greater motivation and I believe make me a stronger candidate.
The Documentary, Waiting for Superman, chronicles the failures of the American education as many student lack access to effective education which every child in this country has the right to. It broke my heart to watch many low income families rest their hopes on a good education for their children on a charter school lottery system and to watch their disappointment when they didn't get in to a charter school. Every child deserves access to a good education and that begins with the teachers in the classroom. The documentary increased my motivation and passion tenfold. Because of that documentary, not only do I want to become a special education teacher, but I also want to open my own school and create an environment that supports great learning; that process starts with becoming a teaching fellow.
Secondly, my current experience as a Teaching Assistant allows me to improve and learn more daily. I see the work full-time teachers put in and I'm ready for that. I work alongside amazing teachers and special educators every day and I learn so much. I learn more about myself every day with the work I do and interaction with the students. I am improving and honing my craft constantly. I am confident I am prepared to lead my own classroom.

",Pre-Service Training,More info about FYIs,"Hi,

I believe you are referring to the note in Ms Noble's PIP. There have been several instances where Ms Noble has repeatedly attributed events in the classroom to factors outside her control. This perspective has led to observation debrief sessions and less formal conversations in which Ms Noble disputes NYCTF staff recommendations. Below are some specific instances:
On 7/13 Ms Noble responded to my feedback about giving specific WTD directions and aligning her lessons to the provided curriculum with, ""This is the third day, they don't do this the way they need to."" She meant that the problem was her students, not her directions or unaligned plan. 
On 7/14 I entered an FYI that describes Ms Noble's reaction to feedback regarding exit ticket procedures at our site.
Today Ms Noble told her TAD and LI and several fellows that I instructed our coach group to post an agenda and objective for the second technique assessment. I did not, I held up the rubrics and pointed out that there was no component for posting objectives, but she persisted to report misrepresentation around the site.
I hope these additional notes help to clarify. Please reply if you need additional information.

Best,

To Whom It May Concern:
It is with great displeasure that I write this letter on behalf of my resignation as an ELA Teaching Fellow at the School of Authors , effective October 14, 2016. From the time of my hire until now. I have endured challenges that have prevailed far beyond any training, professional development or support that I have received through New York City Teaching Fellows and administration at P.S. 108. Unfortunately, I leave the school with the regret of losing relationships with the few students and staff members that have made my days as a teacher memorable, as well as the regret of adding to the ongoing list of needs within the building. 
Id like to thank those is this campus community who have been helpful and kind throughout my duration at the School of Authors. While I understand that the first year of teaching is mostly a growing process, I cannot help but feel wilted by the lack of support, response and organization that has contributed to my duties as an educator. I also understand that each academic environment is a lot like a village, and takes tremendous efforts on all parts to function efficiently. Please consider that my leave involves a strong philosophy I have regarding education, as well my revelation in seeing that my abilities are perhaps different than what was expected of me.
Thank you all at Brooklyn College and NYCTF for giving me the opportunity to learn and teach. 

Sincerely,

Jade Mapp

She said that she was not really aware that she said shit  has a lot of acronyms for shit that she usually uses instead - and indicated that she thought the interaction was in a conversational tone.  She says she's overwhelmed and confused and believes things arent communicated clearly and that she's had a rough deal. By the end of the call, she seemed to understand next steps and indicated she would be professional moving forward.  ",Professionalism,Level 3 follow up email,"Good afternoon Lakeisha,

I am writing to follow up on the conversation we had on July 27th, 2016 regarding professionalism.  As we discussed today, I am concerned because of the use of unprofessional language when speaking to a student, specifically a curse word.   When working with students it is important to keep in mind that we have to model professionalism at all times and cursing at, or in front of a student does not meet the  professionalism expectations of NYCTF.

Please keep in mind that the essential professional traits complement our performance expectations, and the skills you are expected to master to enter the classroom at the start of the school year.  As we discussed, you will be contacted by the NYCTF office this evening in regards to any next steps.

Please understand that this concern stems from a desire to ensure that all fellows who enter the classroom possess the essential traits that new teachers must have to be successful teachers in high-needs schools.  

If you have any questions or to discuss this further, please feel free to contact me by phone, (718) 697-9864 or email.

Regards,

Andy

I attempted to reach the office earlier today, but was unable to reach anyone there. I am sending this e-mail to respectfully withdraw from my position as a Biology Immersion Fellow. After careful consideration and other personal reasons I believe it is not only in my best interest, but in the best interest of my students to withdraw from my position as a 2016 Fellow.

I believe that it would be unfair to my students to carry on in a position that I am not as passionate about. When I originally applied for Fellows I was under the impression that we had to pick our three top interest areas on our application. If I knew that wasnt the case I would only have put Special Education. My dream is to work in a D-75 school with students with moderate to severe disabilities. To advocate for those who can not advocate for themselves and make sure they receive the education they are entitled to. I know there are several qualified Biology fellows and I wish them the best, but at this time I feel it is necessary to pursue my path toward Special Education. 

I would like to thank New York City Teaching Fellows for the opportunity to be part of this program. If there is any need for more Special Education fellows please reach out.

He asked if attendance is taken into consideration, and I explained that all Fellows must meet attendance expectations but it is not considered as additional evidence of readiness to work with students.

He asked if there is an appeals process, and I explained that there is not.

He asked how to find out what other pathways to pursue, so I directed him to the Spark Opportunity website.",Pre-Service Training,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subject: Teaching Fellows departure

Good evening,

After much consideration and a long conversation with my family, I have decided to leave the Teaching Fellows program and this path to becoming an educator. I'm sorry that I couldn't figure this out sooner for all of us, and it has been a very hard decision to make. I have already emailed the Fellows about this.

Thank you Teresa for being a great Hunter coordinator. Please let me know if there's anything I must do to finalize this.

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing today to inquire if you would be interested in deferring your participation in the NYC Teaching Fellows program to the Fall 2016 cohort, which begins at the end of this August.

Given the information you shared about your medical situation, we felt that a deferral would be a good option for you if you wished to continue on with the NYC Teaching Fellows program. 

If you have further questions and/or if you are interested in pursuing this option, please reach out via our Contact Form or give our office a call during our phone hours, 11:30 - 3:30 pm. I'd be happy to share any other information about our Fall cohort with you.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Marie",Deferral,Welcoming Event ,"""Dear Fellows staff, unfortunately I have been in the hospital since Monday, June 13th due to a bacterial infection in my blood that elevated the enzymes in my stomach. Harrowing since all I could think about was will the hospital discharge me in time for PST kickoff on Friday, June 17th. Really heartbroken as my heart was set on teaching ESL through the Fellows program to truly make a difference and mold NYC's urban students into scholars, evolving into becoming tomorrow's leaders. I think of my long nights spent studying, hungrily consuming everything I could on how to become an effective teacher that inspires our students to exceed expectations, not just meet expectations. The excitement of being matriculated at Hunter, the exams, online courses, classroom observations, all so time-consuming, but worth every minute. Now through some incomprehensible timing, I am in a hospital bed in tears because I can't attend PST today. I know the Fellows' strict attendance policy, especially on the first day of all days. I almost feel like I am stuck in some unfair nightmare. I understand your ultimate decision. I have paperwork and a letter from the hospital if needed. Please call me at 7184505359. Thank you.
Regards,

I have attempted to call him to follow up and have left voicemails, but he has not called our office. Today I followed up with the email below:

""Hi Michael, 

I wanted to follow up regarding message about medical absences from July 11th. After reviewing your attendance throughout pre-service training I do see that you still have your 2 emergency absences. 

We would advise you to use your 2 emergency absences for any doctor's appointments you have to make. If you have to miss any days in addition to your 2 absences please reach back out to us for more information.

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out via the Contact Form!

Michael's original email:

""Dear NYCTF, Over the weekend (7/9), I check myself into emergency and had my doctor examine me. It turns out have a number of medical referrals and issues to resolve regarding my current health. For instance I have to arrange to see a cardiologist and pulmonologist. I have spoken to my Training Academy Director, April Broussard, and my coach, Natasha Bruton. April suggested that I notify NYCTF through the Contact Us form. I may have to miss some of the skills building and morning summer school practice in order to meet urgent follow up doctors' orders. I have a medical note from my primary care physician. If you need me to submit the note, I'm happy to do so.  I will do my best to fulfill my attendance requirement, but asking medical excused absences for referral doctor appointments.  Your consideration in this matter is most appreciated. Sincerely, Michael S. Pak  (cohort 27)""",Pre-Service Training,,,,,,

Q13: 

     There are always two sides to every argument. The discussion is on to ban single-sex classrooms or to allow single-sex classrooms into the public school system. Each side has strong logic on why their argument is correct. And the side that has the most compelling information, and research is on the topic of not to segregate boys and girls in the classroom. The other side has compelling argument, but not enough proof in what is being stated in order to have single-sex classrooms. I choose the side of not to segregate the boys and girls in classroom, because the facts are in place and the evidence shows real time outcome.  
     With intergraded classrooms in public schools it has been shown the best way to teach children as individuals is to focus on each learning style rather then there sex. It creates a proper learning environment, and the child will excel in the class due to the different learning styles, and diverse personalities. Single-sex class takes away from stereotypes such as boys liking to play football, and girls liking to dance. Students deserve the chance to explore other opportunities in school that they would not the chance to in a single-sex school.
   The authors in both articles have valid points on why classroom should, and should not be single-sex. Each reason is very compelling. Banning single-sex classrooms will allow students to explore the other sex, and open to new activities. Not banning it will allow for structure, and a lower divorce rate. Each side is compelling.


Q14:  

     
       Looking at history single-sex schools was the way to go.  It worked for those who were of high class, and wealthy. Now that we are in the 20th century times have changed along with idea and style of education. With this public school districts should not segregate boys and girls in the classroom. There are many reasons to this, which include sex discrimination, stereotypes between genders, and economic privilege. For the most part it can do more harm then good.
    According to The National Association for Single Sex Public Education states that the number of public schools offering single sex schools in the U.S lowered to 500, offered single-sex educational opportunities for the year of 2011-2012. This is in part due to the stereotypes that are reinforced. It is becoming popular in the low-income areas. These are issues that the public school system has to deal with on a daily basis. From a 2011 article in the Journal Science concluded that sex-segregated education is deeply misguided; sex segregation increases gender stereotyping, and legitimizes institutional sexism.
   On the other hand single sex classrooms may provide some great benefits such as schools have order with the uniforms, a ridged discipline, and a sense of togetherness. When students share a classroom or school with another gender it allows to students to branch out on their interest in activities, learn a skill they never knew they had.

Good Afternoon,

I have decided to resign because after 7 weeks of training I personally don't believe I am equipped to teach, and that's not reflective of the progran but how I feel as an individual. I am aware that resigning I will not be able to apply again. Thank you for the opportunity.

I would like to take the time and sincerely thank you for extending the offer and accepting me into your Teaching Fellows program.  As the summer vastly approaches, I am sure you are anticipating the welcoming of your 2016 Fellowship.

However, I regret to inform you that I will not be able to further pursue candidacy for this position. Though your program is impressive, and the selection process was highly competitive, unfortunately I am unable to make such a transition for the upcoming school year and will no longer be moving forward with the process at this time.

I thank you, wholeheartedly, for your interest in me as a Special Education teacher and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

Learning is not just about book knowledge, it is also about applying the knowledge to life's many situations.  I want to help them reach their highest potential not just in school but in life and their future careers.  To impact just one child is satisfactory, but to impact many is beyond words.

I have great passion and knowledge and skills to help many students and their parents.  The answers that I have given above are not just words for word sake, they are my conviction on educating all children despite their socioeconomic, ethnic and cultural backgrounds.  I want to be that lighthouse at the end of a child's journey, the one guiding them and their parents on a successful path to education.

I've called the Fellows office yesterday and explained why and when I resigned from the program and DOE.  I was asked to send an electronic copy of my resignation letter in this form.

Dear Ms. Glauner,

Please accept this letter as a formal notification that I am resigning from the position of an Algebra teacher from the Department of Education, effective Friday, October 28th, 2016.

It is with mixed feelings that I am writing this letter as I enjoyed the students, staff and administration of the school. However, after evaluating my life goals I found that they are not aligned with my current profession.

I kindly request that you send the resignation confirmation letter at your earliest convenience. I wish for the school to achieve all the goals youve established and exceed them.

Sincerely,




Khaya Efraim

Subject: Resignation 
 
Dear Prof. Napoli,

After a long consideration, I've decided to resign from the Fellows program. There are several reasons for it but the main one is, I've been teaching English in foreign countries for the last 7 years, mostly to young learners and when I came back to US, I wanted to get a Masters degree in early education. Instead, Fellows placed me into Math Immersion. 
I think it's a waste of my time and Fellows money for me to spend the next 2 years getting a degree, I have no interest in using.

So, with sadness (and a little relief), I've resigned from DOE and Fellows as of yesterday and I thought I should also let you know personally before you found out from the Fellows.

I want to thank you for you support this summer! I got my Bachelors at University of Connecticut many years ago and I didn't have professors there who were so open and supportive as you are. 

Please let me know if there is any paperwork I need to fill out or do anything else.

With Kindest Regards,
Khaya Efraim

Hi John,
We were just notified by the Office of Personnel Investigations that there is an OPI flag for Zakeya Rodriguez. She may be notified today by  Principal Tottenham  who has been notified but I wanted to flag this for you as she cannot be working with kids while shes being investigated. We are not sure how long the investigation will be but if she has an open case, she may not be able to continue with the program depending on how long it takes for her case to be resolved. I will loop back with next steps, but for now, she may not be in the classrooms with students.

Thank you for the time and consideration you put into your application with NYCTF. Though you were not selected for this year, we would never want to dissuade you from pursuing a career in the classroom!

Please consider other teaching certification programs through the NYC Dept of Education: http://schools.nyc.gov/Careers/default.htm. You might be interested in other alternative certification pathways like the NYC Teaching Collaborative, or you might want to look at the requirements for pursuing a traditional pathway into education.

Thank you again, and we wish you all the best on your future endeavors!

Kindly,

I requested that he follow-up to confirm his resignation in writing.,Withdrawal,Context about rating from 8/4,"Hello Lauren, 

I apologize as I am only seeing this now. :( 

Hagai's rating improved tremendously for his last observation due to, in part, many of the most difficult students being absent that day. During that day, there were 11 students, as oppose to the regular 14-16 students. 

For Classroom culture, most students complete the task and what the worksheet he was asking them to complete. Only one student in a back corner was off task. They were following behavioral expectations and directions (except for same said student). Students were continuously working as he gave them multiple problems in varying difficulties. He did have to remind them to continue working on other problems after they finished the first one (their pick) but they did so. 

For essential content, I always consider Hagai to be strong in this aspect, nonetheless, it was difficult to assess because his CT was continuously changing topics and asking them to not do Algebra work but what would be considered 7th-8th-grade work. -- As a note, she had very low expectations of the class and eventually said she did not want to recommend anyone to take the Regents even as that's essentially why they were in that class for. The lesson was focused on quadratic equations and how to find the answers or zeros. 

The content did advance students toward grade level standards and goals as well as the activities (problems) were directly related to what he wanted them to reach. Like I mentioned earlier, I think this is Hagai's strong point and he constantly helped his other two Fellow teachers with the planning of their lessons. He also translated the work and put directions in Spanish as the majority of the class only spoke Spanish and understood limited English many of them did not verbalize concepts in English. 

For Demonstration of Learning, 

Although most students did not verbally participate, this could be their language as most of them did not speak English, they did have answers written that worked and follow the explanation/model Hagai had provided them. If students completed the task he created, as they were, Hagai would be able to have data that would give him information (data) on how well the students understood the lesson. The only part that I would consider a growth is the academic writing and explain their work. 

Hopefully, this provides some info, again, the main factors were: difficult students missing, lesson planning directly relating to Algebra 1, and his addition of multiple level problems to get data.

Hello! 

I am concerned because as Hagai's coach this PIP was discussed with him on Friday after the home coaches' first observation. I explained to him what his scores were and acknowledge that there would need to be some improvements in order for him to complete the program. Other coaches were also in the room as this conversation took place. 

I take full responsibility for not finally submitting the pip because I wanted to wait for the conversation to happen first and then never clicked submit. 

Nonetheless, throughout the process he was aware of his low scores as he and his wife were concerned about him being able to complete the program. 

Let me know if there is any other information I can provide. 

Thanks!

Best,

I am a Fall 2016 Teaching Fellow whose status is currently under review. 
I'm writing to call to your attention an addition that appeared for the 
first time yesterday in my Teacher Track account: a tab labeled 
Performance, containing a Performance Improvement Plan from my coach, 
Maria Rios, dated 7/29/16. This tab and document have not previously 
appeared in my account, and this is the first time I have seen the PIP. 
The information in the PIP was never communicated to me during PST, 
either orally or in writing, and in fact I was given no warning that I 
was in danger of failing the program.

In support of my assertion, please note that the PIP states: ""At this 
time, it is critical that you focus on your development as a teacher; as 
such, you may not continue searching for full-time teaching positions 
and your information will no longer be available to hiring 
representatives."" This did not occur. I continued to receive numerous 
job inquiries from hiring representatives who said they received my 
contact information from the NYCTF or the DOE database. These inquiries 
only stopped on Monday, August 8, when I received the status email from 
NYCTF. In fact, on August 2 Ms. Rios herself sent out an email of job 
opportunities and she included me as a recipient.

I'm concerned that the sudden appearance of the PIP in my account 
presents an inaccurate picture of my evaluation experience during PST, 
and would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.

Thank you,

Hagai Rifkind

Hagai and Maria prepped immensely for his final observation, and for the first time he somewhat implemented the feedback. Several students were also absent that day. I don't recall after debriefing with his coach that we landed on a three. I'll have to go back to my notes (don't have them on me now). He definitely had a pip conversation.

",Pre-Service Training,Context about PIP,"Hi Lauren, 

As we discussed earlier, I was in the room when Maria debriefed with Hagai and discussed his PIP. At the training academy the coaches met in rm 434 to debrief and put in formal ratings during some of the skills building sessions. After I had discussed the PIP with one of my fellows, I was there entering ratings. That is when Maria met with Hagai. 

I hope this is helpful.

",Pre-Service Training,Context about PIP,"Hi Lauren,

Yes, Maria and I shared a room many times for our debriefings with our fellows. Maria spoke at length with me and other coaches, as well as our TAD, about strategies for supporting Hagai, and it was common knowledge among coaches that he had a PIP. I specifically recall her meeting with Hagai at the same time I was meeting with another fellow, and the tone of their conversation was very serious. I did not hear the exact words she was saying, but it was clear they were discussing his PIP.

I have a few financial questions that I need answered before I make my final decision. I might be misinterpreting information but I've got different answers from the fellows handbook and my university.1) If I withdraw from my grad program at the end of the semester, how much of the tuition would I be responsible for covering?2) Is there any specific timing that would minimize this cost?3) If I'm dropped from from the program at the end of the semester due to academic standing, how will this affect what I owe?4) Will I owe any additional money to the DOE or NYTCF?5) It's my understanding that if I withdraw from my grad school, I lose my trans B and would have to leave my position at school. Is this correct or would I be able to finish out the year?Thank you for your time and patience,Thomas Savino",Withdrawal,,,,,,,,,

Hi Jaquelyn,

I'm following up regarding the Professional Development request you contacted us with a couple of weeks ago. I called and left a voicemail with the following information as well.  

We've spoken with the AP at your school and the dates in July for PD have been approved. You are able to attend training on the following dates: July 20th, 21st, and 26th (it is the 26th instead of the 22nd). However, please note that you are not approved to attend the August 1-5 training, you will attend your regular PST on those dates. 

If you have any questions regarding this you can reach out via the Contact Form or call during our phone hours (11:30am-3:30pm).

Jaquelyn's Initial Response:

I am responding to a previous email. The school that is requiring professional development is ps 226 which I was hired at. They have recently done my nomination and have the teaching fellows hiring form which I was told would be sent back to me this coming week. The school is actually in very close proximity to my training academy so I would be only a little late to training or maybe something could be worked out that I go to professional development training for 2 out of the 4 hours?",Pre-Service Training,Professional Development,"Hi Jaquelyn, 

Thank you for reaching out about this. I've gone ahead and logged this information and we'll be able to get back to you at a later date on whether or not this professional development will be approved. If you could provide a little more information regarding this request, such as if you have been hired by this school and a little more detail on what will be covered at these days of professional development.

To whom it may concern, 

I am a teaching fellow for the 2016 school year and am a Multi grade 1-6 with bilingual extension fellow, I wanted to know if I would be able to accept employment at a dual language school or if I could only work for a transitional bilingual program or what were the requirements for either?

thanks in advance,

We let her know that there is not an appeals process, but that we were happy to answer any questions she had.

Katherine asked what additional evidence we considered, and we shared that we considered her performance as well as her professionalism concerns and her professionalism concern letter to determine a holistic picture of her readiness to enter the classroom. 

Katherine shared that she believed she was getting low ratings from her home coach, and higher ratings from her swap coach. I shared that her home coach and swap coach gave her the same ratings during her final week, and that multiple staff including her LI and her TAD sat in on her observations.

Katherine shared that when she received her PIP, her coach told her that she would be successful, and that her  coach only gave her high ratings at the end because she was receiving the support of a PIP. We discussed how we as a program issue PIPs as a support so that Fellows are able to rapidly improve, so this is an expected outcome of a PIP - that Fellows would receive additional support from staff and show improvement. .

Katherine mentioned that different concerns were shared with her principal than what were in the EPT Concern Letter, so we reiterated what was in the EPTCL for her and that this is the context we shared with the principal. 

Katherine asked us if her Coach perceived the threat because of Katherine's use of her hands when she speaks and cultural tone - we reiterated that the threat was perceived based on the language of the statement she made, and was not based on her culture.

Katherine shared with us a letter that the Coach at her hiring school had written, as well as several lesson plans and notes she had written for her students.

Katherine shared that she has spoken with her attorney, and that she will likely be filing a written complaint. She expressed concern that she had spoken with Jill Custodio and Laura Rincon earlier in the summer about her concerns with her coach, and asked how we follow up when concerns such as this one are raised.

Katherine showed us a document on which she had documented her concerns with her Coach. When we asked if she had shared that with the program, she let us know that she had not because she did not feel like she could share it with her training staff.",Pre-Service Training,Email from Principal,"Katherine's hiring principal sent the following email to Lauren:

Subject: Katherine Vargas 
 
Hello Ms. Cohan,

I am writing to you because I understand that you are meeting with Katherine Vargas tomorrow regarding her future with the Teaching Fellows. 

I intended Ms. Vargas to be a 7th grade humanities teacher at our school, Hamilton Grange Middle School,
Back in June or early July and had every intention of seeing her start the year with us until I was informed on Friday that I would be unable to hire her because the Teaching Fellows were terminating their relationship with her. 

She has spent one to two days each week since this time meeting with me, her co-teacher, and/or our instructional coach to create curriculum for the coming school year. During this time she has shown her thoughtfulness in the planning process and an openness and receptivity to feedback. It should also be mentioned that she is not being financially compensated for this work. 

Should you have any other questions regarding her time with us, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

In Unity,



Benjamin Lev
",Withdrawal,Pre-Outplacement Conversation,"Katherine came into the office to talk about her outplacement. Since we had flagged that we wanted Anna or Shauna in this conversation and no one was available to handle the meeting with me, Maggie and Meha and I decided that we should tell her that we have a few people out of office and we would set up a meeting for her when someone was available. We basically ended up having the outplacement conversation anyway in the hallway. It lasted over 15 minutes and we talked through a number of the basic questions (there's no appeals process and no opportunity to reverse the decision; a team makes holistic decisions based on all the info we have about performance, attendance, professionalism, etc.; she can always go teach through another program besides NYCTF or NYCTC, etc.). She got stuck on the point that there was no option to appeal or reverse the decision because she said a friend of hers had their decision reversed. I told her I couldn't speak to other fellows, but that for the fellows in her score range, there was no appeals process.  She kept repeating this point, stating that she wanted to share all the information she had about her coach so we could get a better picture of her performance and re-evaluate her. She claimed her coach didn't like her and gave her low scores and documented things about her. She also said that she overheard her coach say things about her. She wanted us to consider the opinion of the Principal at her site, who saw the way her coach treated her. I assured her that we took into account multiple perspectives and multiple pieces of information and that the determination does not ride on one person's opinion. She also asked for her ratings and PIP and I told her we could share that with her since it's no longer available since she's been withdrawn in TT2. ",Withdrawal,Issued EPT CL,I spoke to Katherine on the phone regarding her EPT CL.

My name is Sarah Kelly, and I am the sister of Morgan Kelly, who was accepted to the New York Teaching Fellows Program, and is scheduled to begin with you later this month.  Unfortunately, Morgan is currently in the hospital, and we don't anticipate that he will be well enough to resume work in time for your start date.  I wanted to reach out on his behalf to ask if it would be possible for Morgan to be deferred to your September start date/fall cohort.  I'd be happy to provide any information necessary to make a decision regarding a medical deferral, or speak to you at any time, should that be helpful.  You can reach me at sarahjeankelly@gmail.com or (617) 216-1052.  I look forward to hearing from you, and appreciate your consideration of this request.

Hi Dana,

Thank you for following up. Since speaking with you, I've followed up three additional times with other NYCTF representatives in an attempt to arrange accommodations.

The questions that you're asking below are ones that we already discussed in person and it doesn't appear that you've made any headway in arranging these accommodations. As I mentioned when we spoke, these accommodations take time to arrange and I'm concerned that you will not be able to adequately accommodate me. There are still videos on Blackboard that have not been captioned and that are still inaccessible to me. At this point, I'm reluctant to leave my job and invest in fingerprinting and certification exams if I'm not going to be appropriately accommodated.

To briefly answer your questions:
1) I've used FM systems since elementary school. And I've used CART services since high school.
2) I've used the FM system to reduce the signal to noise ratio and the CART system to read what I wasn't able to make out through the FM system.
3) Phonak provides the FM system. You would need to consult with them around a system that would meet our needs as I don't know what the listening environment is typically like. I've used Mirabai Knight of StenoKnight for CART services in the past.
4) I am happy to provide you with a copy of my audiological evaluation (please see attached). This is protected health information and it should not be disseminated further without my written permission.

I was never informed that I needed to reach out to the University directly for accommodations -- I will contact them today and see if I make any headway. With immersion beginning next Monday, I'm not very hopeful.

Please let me know by COB tomorrow if you've made any headway.

Thank you,
Navena Chaitoo
",Deferral,Deferred,"Dear Dean Hostetter,

We met with Navena today to coordinate her accommodations for pre-service training and what she could expect during the 2016-17 school year.   Navena let us know that the team at Relay was very helpful and quickly turned around to support her accommodation, which led to a successful first day of Immersion.   

While Navena is ultimately looking forward to joining the NYC Teaching Fellows program, the uncertainty around the level of accommodations that she might receive during pre-service training and during the 2016-17 school year has made her reluctant to pursue this opportunity for June 2016.  She has therefore chosen to defer her acceptance to next year (June 2017).  We are going to continue having her go through our accommodation coordinator at the DOE so that we can let her know what services she would be provided for next year.

Thank you for providing accommodations for Navena on such a tight turnaround and we are sorry that she will not be continuing in the program this year.  Please note we advised her that she did not need to attend tomorrow since she will be deferring.  We know this may impact the services you were intending to provide this week, and I believe Navena will be coming by tomorrow to drop off some equipment that she was provided.

Thank you for understanding, and we will be in touch early next year regarding Navenas potential enrollment at Relay.  I am copying her so that she has a record of this message.

Sincerely,
Izaak

         Good afternoon, as you may know, the New York City Teaching Fellows have unfortunately terminated me from the program as of today, August 15, 2016. I must share with you that I feel extremely disrespected and perplexed about the way I was notified about my termination from the program. If you take a look at my NYCTF and Pace University profiles this summer, they have been more than professional, regardless of all the difficulties and unfairness I was put through. For that reason, I feel that the way I am being treated by the program is not reciprocal. It is unfair and rather cruel to have received a simple termination email after being placed in a Masters degree program, teaching NYC students, and given false encouragement by my coaches and site director all throughout.  This shows a lack of transparency and frankness from the NYCTF. I also strongly believe that I was not given a fair chance since the very beginning of my placement at Charles O Dewey Middle School. My certification was General Education 7-12 Biology and I was placed in a 6th grade ELA class with 25 students, some of who had IEPs (Individualized Education Program) which are given to Special Education students. I was never notified about this, yet my coaches expected me to have 100% attention from students every time. On one occasion, my coach tried to discipline one of my most misbehaved students and she was completely unsuccessful, however this (among many things) was not taken into consideration and was graded extremely tough.  I was clearly told by my site director that the unfairness I was being put through was reported to a higher official and that the Fellows would take it well into consideration. There were also many disparities such as fellows who had a class of only 2 students, and inconsistencies about the way fellows were being graded, among other things such as clear favoritism, conjectural racism, and unfair grading. On three occasions, I heard about coaches going back to two fellow profiles to adjust their ratings. Lastly, the fact that my teacher track account has been deactivated is extremely questionable. I can no longer access ANY of my NYCTF documents and Pre Service Training performance information. I was also not told how to go about continuing my career as a teacher nor what will happen with my master's program. I have many questions. Today I am kindly asking you to provide me with an e-report that contains each and every document I submitted through teacher track as well as a full and detailed report that shows exactly how the NYCTF came about making a final decision to terminate me from the program. In the past, I have received an email back in a timely manner from the NYCTF, therefore I also expect to hear a response within three days. I am looking forward to hear from you, should I not, I will be forced to contact higher authorities, the Office of the Mayor, the NYC Department of Education, and the media. 

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Greetings Grant,

     As you may know, the New York City Teaching Fellows have unfortunately terminated me from the program as of August 15, 2016. I must share with you that I feel extremely disrespected and perplexed about the way I was notified about my termination from the program. If you take a look at my NYCTF and Pace University profiles this summer, they have been more than professional, regardless of all the difficulties and unfairness I was put through. For that reason, I feel that the way I am being treated by the program is not reciprocal. It is unfair and rather cruel to have received a simple termination email after being placed in a Masters degree program, teaching NYC students, and given false encouragement by you and my other coaches. This shows a lack of transparency and frankness from the NYCTF.

     I also strongly believe that I was not given a fair chance since the very beginning of my placement at Charles O Dewey Middle School. My certification was General Education 7-12 Biology and I was placed in a 6th grade ELA class with 25 students, some of who had IEPs (Individualized Education Program) which are given to Special Education students. I was never notified about this, yet my coaches expected me to have 100% attention from students every time. On one occasion, my coach tried to discipline one of my most misbehaved students and she was completely unsuccessful, however this (among many things) was not taken into consideration and was graded extremely tough. 

    You clearly told me that the unfairness I was being put through was reported to a higher official and that the Fellows would take it well into consideration. You gave me false encouragement by telling me that I was going to be fine if I kept working hard.  Told me to keep trying and always mentioned ""September"" and ""the fall."" When you told me I was on PIP I decided to give it my all.  I was never absent, and never late. Everything you guys told me to do, I did. You guys clearly told me I was going to get extra support during my training but the picture you find attached is clearly not the support I deserved after being more than professional at your training site during this summer. You more than anyone know that I was being placed in the worst situation and I was not given a chance to really prove myself. You more than anyone know about all the inconsistencies, disparities, and favoritism that happened during PST.  I do not want to believe the rumors about you and coaches going back to adjust other fellow's ratings just because one of your coaches was grading very tough. Why did you not do that for me? Why was I not treated the same? I never disrespected you, I trusted that you would help me grow, and always looked up to you as a professional. I did not deserve to just be used and thrown out by the program in such a horrible, unfair, and cruel way.

     Today, I am kindly asking you to put in a word for me, since I never asked for much. I have heard that the fellows won't give me a chance, but I can't just give up now. How would you feel if you were in my situation? I feel that is it important that I receive an e-report that contains each and every document I submitted through teacher track (since it has been deactivated) as well as a full and detailed report that shows exactly how the NYCTF came about making a final decision to terminate me from the program.

I thank you for taking the time to read this email and I hope to hear from you very soon.

I was eager to gain additional experience working hands on in the classroom environment with a different age group before attending the program. After I graduated from New York University, I began working in a pre-kindergarten classroom in a catholic school. With this background, I have been gaining experience with early development, and working with small groups of students to focus on writing letters and numbers. I really enjoy watching the children get excited about learning. It is phenomenal to watch a child learn to write their name or something that was once difficult for them. All of my experiences working with children have motivated me to want to work in the classroom environment and promote a love for learning. I have had the opportunity to work in many different environments with a variety of age groups. I would like to be the best teacher that I could be with a well-rounded background.

Thank you for e-mailing me. I hope that your wife is doing much better. I was under the impression that you had quit yesterday given the manner that you left and that you turned in your computer and keys. Please confirm that is not the case. Additionally, your direct deposit was cancelled as a result. You may speak to Kim as far as what you may need to do. Keep me posted.

Hi Mr. Palton,
   I apologize for leaving so abruptly today. I had a family crisis over the weekend that really shook me up. My wife is diabetic and she had an episode, I woke up to find her unresponsive. I should have taken the day off but I came in and was feeling very overwhelmed. I was not in the frame of mind to be in the classroom. I will not be coming in tomorrow due to her current medical condition. I will keep you posted if I require more time.
Thank you for your continued support,
Chris Bogen

Peter Giambalvo 
License: Special Education  Substitute 
File #:  1572972

Good Afternoon Mr. Giambalvo,

Thank you for your efforts on behalf of Hudson High School thus far this school year.  However, the position of ICT teacher in a high school classroom requires a pedagogue with a foundation in lesson planning, differentiation and classroom management.  Though willing, you have not demonstrated a capacity to meet the professional requirements necessary for this work.  Our students are not being served.  

Therefore, let this letter serve as an official notice that your service with Hudson will be terminated as of November 18, 2016. 

It is my hope that with additional training, and some reflection on the role of the special educator, you will develop the instructional capacity necessary for this work and reapply to the New York City Department of Education once your certification is complete.

Respectfully,


Nancy Logozzo
Principal
",None,P's concern re: Fellow performance,"Principal called this afternoon to discuss her concerns about Fellow's performance. She stated that the Fellow does not know how to differentiate. She observed him teach a theater class this morning - Fellow has a Theater background - and noted that Fellow does not exhibit the ""basics of teaching"" (e.g. lack of clear goals and objectives). Instead, he was observed spending 25 minutes trying to explain the project. The Principal asked the Fellow at the end of the observation to share his lesson plan, and he hasn't yet shared it with her as of the time of the call (~4:30pm). 

She also shared that his DOE mentor, who co-teaches a social studies class with him, reported to the Principal that having the Fellow in the classroom is like ""having another kid in the class.""  

I shared that his evaluation showed that he was able to engage students, and that perhaps the current school isn't the right fit, or that he could work better with middle school students, which is the age group he worked with during summer training. I advised her that if he really isn't a good fit for the school, he can be terminated but with a 10-day notice. Mid-year Fellows are not an option for her since the 7-12 SPED group are slated for D75. I shared the Hiring Support email address, as well as informed her that the New Teacher Application is launching in December so should have a small number of candidates available for hire sometime that month. She will be processing the information I provided and will share her next steps with me at a later time. ",None,P's inquiry re: discontinuance,"From: Allen Patricia

As per our conversation, I am copying Nuree Choe so that she is aware that Mr. Giambalvo is not working out. Please also reach out to your superintendent so that she is aware that you want to move forward with terminating him.

Good Morning Patricia,
 
I am wondering what my options are for discontinuing Peter Giambalvo?  He is a fellow that has been hired as a 52B? license  long term substitute.  I know I have the option of not hiring him at the end of the year, but can I let him go mid year?

I have been moved when I build trusting relationships with my students. I am moved when they, consciously or not, reveal their struggles to me; or when I learn their personalities and am able to recognize when they are challenged and when they feel rewarded. Despite not being accepted into Teaching Fellows last year, I am no less motivated to pursue this career path. Over the past few years of working with special and mainstream education students, I have found myself, consciously or not, acquiring and refining skills necessary for successful teaching. Communicating, relationship building, and the ability to recognize the obstacles are among these skills. While I am consistently moved when seeing my students succeed over academics and personal challenges, what drives me to pursue this career is that I am energized by being the force that helps them achieve these successes. This year, I am no less confident that I will make a successful teacher and have a positive impact on the students who find me at the head of their class. Since I last applied I have had more practice planning lessons and am more prepared to assess what is necessary for a lesson plan. I believe I will come into the interview with a solid plan and deliver an effective lesson, earning myself a fellowship and setting in motion a rewarding and successful career.

""Hello,

In Mary Olivers poem, When Death Comes, she writes that when death comes, I want to say all my life that I was a bride married to amazement.

When asked to think about finishing the sentence last week, I teach because I could only think of Mary Olivers poem. I think about how the most thrilling and most rewarding moments in my life have come from this sort of amazement. This scary, yet so important ability to be excited by not knowing. I teach because I want my students to be comfortable not knowing. I want my students to be excited by the thought of being married to amazement.

Im writing to let you know that I wish to withdraw from the New York City Teaching Fellows.

Im not a match for NYCTF for a few small reasons: I bristle at acronyms, clapping in unison makes me grumpy, and Ive never been a good candidate for bureaucrat.

Im not a match for NYCTF for some really big reasons too. 
 
I hope to never again be in a situation where Im spoken to this way. I hope this for my colleagues as well. Ive had too many interactions with coaches who were openly condescending to me. (This isnt true of all coaches, of course. Some of the coaches Ive met have been brilliant and absolutely inspiring.) But Ive had coaches talk to me as if Im lazy, as if Im a jerk, as if I couldnt possibly understand. And Ive witnessed even worse directed at my colleagues. This is exploitative, disrespectful, and it betrays all of the very hard work weve doneand the hard work weve committed to do in the future. 

I cant spend any more time with the very vocal contingent of fellows who find only time to complain about the amount of work they have to do. By overemphasizing the workload, the amount of sacrifice required to be a fellow, how this will be the most difficult thing you will do in your life, NYCTF has installed a culture of complaining about how much work there is, rather than a culture of engagement with how important and meaningful that work could be.

And despite promises of the programs rigorousness, Ive been disappointed by my university experience. Many of my colleagues at LIU Brooklyn quite obviously arent interested in doing the work of advocating for students with disabilities. Some of them have even bargained with professors to make the readings and assignments fewer, shorter, easier. Even scoffed at some of the very accommodations and services we might provide for our students. The work has not been rigorous.

Monday morning I woke up and I was sick with knowing I couldnt do this anymore. Somewhere deep down in my gutswhere my body decides right from wrongI realized I had hit my limit. I had gone in to NYCTF too many days, knowing that it just wasnt right. 
 
But my heart is broken also. I cant continue in this program, which means Im not going to get to meet the students I was excited to teach, and learn from, in the fall. Ive met some amazing New Yorkers who are, no doubt, going to go on to do amazing things in classrooms all over this city. And Ive met coaches whose students, certainly, are the luckiest. 

Im not through with educationI look forward to finding out how else I can support learning, support young weird minds bursting with wonder. And I look forward to living up to Mary Olivers challenge: When its over, I dont want to wonder if I have made of my life something particular, and real.

Thank you for everything so far.

Sincerely,

Willie Filkowski""",Withdrawal,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think I am a much stronger candidate this time around, because unlike when I applied previously, I am coming with some relevant classroom experience and not from the private sector. I think my experience in the classroom has made me become more open to embracing a culture of feedback, mentoring and observation in order to raise standards and expectations from students. I understand now, that as an educator in any capacity, you are always a student as well, from your principal, co-teachers, mentors and from your students. It is a career of lifelong learning, so that you can teach others.

Her notes are below.

I spoke with Sam about his concerns about his classroom today. He shared that it has been a very challenging classroom for the summer. When asked to explain some of his specific concerns, he shared that he had been informed by his CT that there was a student who had previously been arrested off school grounds for possession of a weapon. That same student drew a gun on a name tag for his desk. Sam went to his director with these concerns and felt that the director wasnt responsive. I asked Sam what Eric specifically said or did that made him feel this way. He said that Eric shared reasons why this wasnt a severe concern and also raised that he may be making assumptions about the student. I reassured Sam that his concerns are taken very seriously, and that the reason for my visit was to address his concerns. I also shared that the Directors role is to both address those concerns and also support his reflection as a teacher.  I also shared that the site is here to support him and help him grow and develop this summer, and he should absolutely feel comfortable sharing his experiences, reflections, and concerns with any staff member, including his Director. 

I told him that we had heard that he felt unsafe in his classroom and asked him to share more about that. He said, Well, the class has made a lot of progress. I asked him if he felt unsafe now, and he said, no. 

He also shared that there were many struggling students in his classroom, ELL students, and over-age students. He did not feel that his coach took those concerns into consideration when rating him. I shared that all Fellows have different circumstances and contexts in their classrooms, and the coachs evaluations need to look at the success of the instruction and what the students are doing rather than the particular challenges that may impact that classroom. But, I also shared that his coach is absolutely there to support him in developing ways to better support and reach all of his students. 

I concluded the conversation by restating that the staff is here to support his growth and development, and he should continue to reach out to the staff at his site to identify ways to grow, improve, and best serve his students. He thanked me for taking time to visit his classroom and hear out his concerns.

Hi Ari,
 
Unfortunately, he should have contacted you directly. Im sorry that you werent looped in about his withdrawal earlier. Yes, he has been withdrawn as of 8/2/16 for excessive absences. 
 
In terms of getting him off your TO, Manal should be able to assist. Manal, I think you can use the DYE (appoint in error) code.

Hi Nuree,
 
We hired a fellow, Abdel-Minem Musafa at the end of June.
 
About a week ago, he told us that sometime in July, he left the Fellows program and that he had expected them to contact us.
 
No one from the Fellows program had contacted us--and we don't really want him anymore because we hired him expecting him to go through the Fellows training.
 
I just want to talk with someone in the Fellows program about whether (a) this is true, and (b) if it is, how we can get him off our TO.
 
Thanks,
 
Ari

Hi Nuree,
 
Gee, you do a lot!
 
I sent my query to their generic email: Fellows and NYC Teaching Fellows, so I think it disappeared into a black hole.
 
Do you have a name in the Fellows program that I can email or call?

Hi there,
 
Manal, while Im very flattered that you think Im the Executive Director of the Fellows, Im not. Actually there is no such title. Im the Senior Manager for Strategic Operations & Programs at the Office of Teacher Recruitment and Quality and have managed many of the operational pieces to ensure that Fellows and NYC Teaching Collaborative Partner Teachers (our in-house residency program teachers) are onboarded into the DOE. I also oversee the relationships with other alternative certification programs, like TFA and New Visions, the Subsidized Bilingual Extension Program (SBEP), Subsidized TESOL Advanced Certificate program (STAC), and manage other operational pieces within TRQ. 
 
Ari  who did you email about your inquiry? Depending on the context of your situation, I can answer your question or find another colleague who is better positioned to do so. 
 
Best,
Nuree

Eric:  I know you will have been told to ignore my message but please know that I will take legal action to get a response if none is forthcoming. 

As you know, I have been expelled from the Teaching Fellows. 

The NYCTF office said last week that my status would be positive if 1) I had made improvements 2) My attendance record was good and my asssignments were turned in on time. 

Could you please give me the information from my files pertinent to these two issues: 

1) Was my attendance satisfactory? 
2) Was my work submitted on time?
3) Did my scores improve? Hint:They did. 
4) What basis, then, is there for rejecting me?

Marty Schoenhals


Instructed Eric to send the following response to the fellow, BCCing myself and Anna Kelly and then not to respond to any additional inquiries: 


If you could just respond with the following: 

""Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide the information you are requesting below. However, if you get in touch with the Fellows office using the contact form on the website, someone from the program office will be able to answer your questions.""

Please BCC myself and Anna Kelly (CCed here) in your response. After that, you do not need to respond to anything additional- but if he does continue to contact you, definitely continue to forward those messages to us.

Hi Amy,

We ALWAYS pay for immersion costs. We definitely dont cover costs for liberal arts courses if they are deficient for Initial certification requirements, courses they need to retake (for failing or incompletes), and any other courses that are outside the scope and sequence of their masters degree program. 

As the Fellow states, hes at Lehman, and I wonder because Lehman is a new partner and starting from scratch with us technologically and programmatically if there have been some operational hiccups. CUNY hasnt yet billed us for Summer 2016 so Im wondering if Lehmans CUNYFirst platform is showing that the Fellows have a balance, and if at all, that is causing them issues to register for classes or causing any other issues. 

I just spoke with Charlene and she shared that she and Erika have been working with Lehman and TNTP on this since late August. The August 29th date that the Fellow mentions is when Charlene received an email from this group of Fellows. It sounds like the focus was on unclear communications, which Charlene/Erika/TNTP has been working to address.

Charlene/Erika  would you provide some additional context and historical context here on whats been happening and what steps have been taken? 

Thank you,
Nuree

</WFNOTE>
<MSG>Good morning, my name is Brendan Cunningham and Im reaching out on behalf of all New York City Math Immersion Teaching Fellows to bring to your attention critical concerns present in the NYCTF program. 
On August 13th, we forwarded a letter addressing our concerns to an NYCTF staff member. In our letter we detailed the way in which the NYCTF program breached our contractual agreement, burdening Math Immersion Teaching Fellows with thousands of dollars in unexpected tuition costs. Therein, we asked NYCTF to honor our original agreement by paying for tuition costs associated with Math Immersion coursework and also update the website to reflect this information for future Cohorts. On August 29th, with support from our Lehman College Fellows advisor, we forwarded our letter to NYCTF top leadership. Disappointingly, over the past 6 weeks NYCTF has ceased to take action beyond limited email correspondence, thus suggesting our concerns are not being seriously considered. 
The implications of NYCTFs decision to renege on our contractual agreements are considerable and will have damaging financial impacts on Math Immersion Teaching Fellows. Furthermore, NYCTFs inaction as it relates to updating the website to accurately reflect financial obligations related to the Math Immersion program is inexcusable. As the next Cohort enters this application period, there is an equal likelihood they will fall victim to the same misleading elements that we are currently bearing the costs of. 
We would like to see a mutually beneficial solution where our original agreement is honored and the website updated. We also aim to raise awareness with the DOE-NYCTF partnership around where improvements to transparency can be made.
Weve have drawn substantial written support from Math Immersion Fellows and continue to be astounded by the lack of response from NYCTF. 
We have ample evidence supporting NYCTF's breach of contract and would be happy to forward our documentation.</MSG>

The university does not have you registered because you didn't apply. You made out the application but didn't hit 'submit.' Classes started yesterday and you failed to come to the orientation. I will receive a ruling from the Registrar's office if it is too late to have you registered.

You are aware that the DOE provided you with a university profile which includes all of the in formation needed.

Professor Napoli,

   I apologize for not having my paper work together in terms of application and immunization papers. I was wondering if it was at all possible for me to have some extra time to take care of it. I miscalculated how long it would take to get some of the things I needed to do completed on time and will make sure to pull all of it together tomorrow. I hope that I can enter and participate in classes after having gotten my immunization part of my application done despite my lateness.

Thank you for your help,

She stated that that issue was posted on the MTA website, but she was still marked tardy. I explained that any lateness over 20 minutes is the equivalent of one absence, and that with our attendance policy, we do not 'excuse' absences. She thanked me for the clarification and said she understood and would not be late/absent moving forward. She stated that she has since left her house at an earlier time. She said that she previously wrote in regarding needing to attend 3 medical appointments. She stated that she was able to reschedule the two additional medical appointments so as not to interfere with training. ",Pre-Service Training,attendance follow-up call,"I attempted to call Christina on 7/28 but the primary phone number did not connect. I then called the secondary phone number and her mom answered - I left a message asking for Christina to give us a call back tomorrow.
",Pre-Service Training,Medical/Additional Absences,"Christina has reached out again regarding an additional tardy and absence during the first week of PST. After consulting with Lauren, she has been emailed that will be able to go to the two medical appts (in July and August) as long as she doesn't miss any additional days given the tardy and absence  during the first week. Below is the email she's reached out with.

""Hello, I am following up on Gianna's response from my email on June 7th. The day prior, I informed the program that I would have 3 absent or 3 late days in total for this summer. I have having major surgery in mid August and will need to see the Dr. in June, July, and August. I still do not have the dates as of yet but will be seeing the Dr. this Tuesday morning and will hopefully know more then.

Also, I would like to inform the office of a recent happening this past week, Thursday June 23. I was tardy (albeit less than 10 minutes) due to a massive train investigation on the 6 line (from 86th - 42nd street all trains were held more than 30 minutes) which occurred around 4 pm. I left the train and took local transport above ground. I believe that this should not be counted as a tardy as this wasn't my fault. I would have been to class on time, if this had not happened and I needed a re-route. 

After class that evening, I informed my coach that the following day I would either be late or may miss the session; I had just been informed my daughter could be squeezed into the schedule for a psychological screening at the Rose F Kennedy Center in the Bronx. We had been waiting for an appointment for the past 3 months and I clearly could not miss the appointment. Needless to say, at 3:15 we were still in the appointment, and I emailed my coach to let her know I would be absent.

My question is: Are medical appointments considered under the """"emergency absence"""" protocol. It seems that a """"necessary medical appointment"""" is not an emergency, but rather a necessity. Would I need to provide proof of appointment to NYCTF (as I would at any other job position) as to not be penalized. 

Please have someone call me at 929-431-5309 so I can get assurance on this situation.

Best,
Christina""",Pre-Service Training,PST Absences,"As per our attendance policy, missing a couple of hours a day will count as three absences. However, since she is taking the time for medical reasons we will accommodate her request and she may miss for three appointments. On June 28, she will be in university coursework from 12 p.m.  2p.m. Therefore, she should speak to her university coordinator about making up the time she misses. As she will be absent from Field Experience twice between July and August, she will not be able to take any additional time off. Given her responsibility to her students this summer, we also advise her not to miss any days of Field Experience for interviews.  ",Pre-Service Training

He had significant misunderstandings about the program and his performance and indicated that he would ""seek advice"" and potentially take legal action. He seemed to not understand performance expectations at all and kept indicating that he was misled because the program did not state at the application stage that being a Fellow was conditional upon passing PST. I explained that we make all of this clear in the PST Handbook before enrollment and pointed out the expectations on page 25-29.  
He began by mentioning that he was in SPED and was teaching 6th grade math and seemed to indicate that he was switched to 8th grade math. He said he couldn't manage student behavior because he wasn't the teacher of record. I explained how we assess Classroom Culture, Essential Content, and Demonstration of Learning, and also shared that we expect that teachers are able to manage student behavior. I was very confused by what he was explaining; it was not very logical.
He then went on to say that he did not want his record to show that he had professionalism concerns and went into all the ways in which he was professional. At first I thought there was a mix-up with the letters so I asked him to read his letter to me. It's the same letter in his TT2 account which is for performance. He got hung up on the part in quotes which said that Fellows are expected to meet performance and professionalism expectations in order to remain in the program. I explained that was the handbook language explaining what Fellows must do to remain in good standing and then asked him to carefully read the next sentence that explains that he was outplaced for performance reasons - it does not mention that he does not meet professionalism expectations. He was still really confused. I re-explained three more times in different ways but he still had a comprehension issue and did not seem to understand the letter. He asked that the letter be changed and I shared that was not an option. He indicated that he wanted it changed in case someone asked him about the program as a reference. Later on, we went into this in more detail. He explained that if future employers asked for a reference from the program, he didnt want them to think he had professionalism concerns. I explained that I thought the letter was clear and I shared that it was not possible to have the letter changed. I also advised him to make a more thoughtful decision about references and indicated that I dont think we would be the most useful reference for him. He shared that employers might ask if they see it on his resume and indicated that he didnt want to have a gap on his resume. I told him it was his choice but advised that he find an employer to be a reference who would be able to support him.  
He also said that he did not understand that he would be held to performance expectations and did not know anything about the 2.2 performance bar. I referred him to the handbook p. 25-29 and explained that this is clear up front before PST begins. He also mentioned that he was continually told he was doing a good job and received positive feedback and had no sense that he wouldn't pass. I reminded him that he received a PIP. He was upset because he had secured a job and said that he felt he was not warned that he would be held to performance expectations. Again, I explained how we communicate this clearly upfront before PST and that it was his responsibility to read through the materials we provide.  
He mentioned multiple times that he would be seeking advice and pursuing other options including legal options because he felt the program was not acting professionally and wants to make sure the right information is put out there. Again, I indicated that all of this is shared early on in the program, and all of it is in writing before PST even begins. He also asked me to spell my name and position three times throughout the conversation.

""Dear New York City Teaching Fellows,
My name is Bianca Ruiz and I am a New York City Teaching Fellow from cohort 27. I am contacting you today because I have a family emergency. My father had a spinal fusion operation on Thursday, July 21, 2016.  After his operation he has endured many injuries as the result of horrible patient care, therefore he is not doing well at all. I have been staying in the hospital with him every night and day because when I am not there the hospital completes medical task in a brutal manner and they do not take into account his operated area. They have dropped him, poked him and probed him in such ways that I have already filed 2 reports with public relations and requested a hospital transfer. He is undergoing unbearable treatment and I cannot leave him at the moment because we have no one else who can stay with him during the day or overnight. I must stay with him because as an effect of the stress he has endured after the surgery his lungs have begun to collapse and he needs to be under constant vigilance. I have contacted my training director (Patrick Wells) and lead instructor (Diamond Skinner) to inform them that I will not be able to make it to training tomorrow. Yet, I have been absent twice already (Thursday, July 21 and Friday, July 22) due to me having to be with my father and do not wish to be kicked out of the fellows for a situation that is out of my hands.  My work with the fellows is extremely important to me but my fathers health/life is as well. Is there any way that I can be excused from training? I can get medical notes if need be. Please, I really need to be here for him. I am willing to make up any work as soon as he gets better and am really worried about my future with the fellows. I am doing so well and love what I do, I do not want to be penalized for something that is out of my hands. I thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Hello, 

I wanted to inform you that a Fellow at my site: x118 - Edward Rhew, has withdrawn from the program. I'm not sure if he has contacted anyone in the office yet, because he emailed me this morning at 4:30am.

The reason he is withdrawing is because his son has been very sick in the hospital, since last week. Is there anyway he can continue the program at a later time due to the circumstances? Overall, Edward was on track to make it through the program. I told him to reach out to the office to let you know his situation.

Dear Charlene,

Thanks for following up. We have one more fellow, this one from Cohort 27, who is also not in good standing: Gabriel Seijo. Gabriel, a SPED Bilingual fellow, is our only fellow who did not complete DASA. Erika and I discussed that if he did not complete DASA by the beginning of the school year he would be outpaced for not being in good standing with us.  He is also not in good standing with us because he did not enroll for any Fall 2016 coursework and is therefore not attending our program in any capacity.  We also had major professionalism (and personal safety) concerns about this fellow, who physically intimidated one of our female professors when she would not allow him to attend her DASA workshop because he arrived late (we have a very strict punctuality policy for DASA). When she would not allow him to enter her classroom, he pounded on the door so loudly and for so long that she eventually opened the door and he physically pushed his way past her and into the room and refused to leave (after about 30 minutes he walked out).  Please let me know when you send him a letter to let him know he will be outplaced so I can let the registrar know.

Thanks,

Hi Charlene,

Just got word. The D75 HRD is fine with him accepting a Sped Generalist position. We can give him until March 2 to find a position, which is the MY cohort job search deadline. 

Marie and Nuree, FYI. This is a C27 Fellow who was excessed by one school and let go by another. Pace feels strongly about keeping him.

Hey Sarah,

Any update from the HRD on Clinton Moranos situation? Are we providing him with a job search extension? 

Charlene
",Job Search,School dissatisfaction with Fellow,"District 75 HRD called to say that school is dismissing Fellow due to poor teacher performance and engagement at school. Teacher was in National Guard and missed beginning of school year. He was originally at K753 but was excessed and reassigned to K371 in November due to budgetary reasons. His current principal is very displeased with his teaching practice, and he isnt showing improvement. Shes moving to dismiss him  hes currently working under the long-term sub license.  This is second school.  
Field Supervisor is Terence Egan, a recently retired D75 AP. Transferred with him.  He feels that he can work with Clinton and make him a better teacher. He doesn't seem to be in his element at this school. Most teachers are female. He seems to be all by himself. Does not appear to be part of school community. 

Clinton is in average standing at Pace but they want to support him. ",None,Issued EPT CL,"Spoke to Clinton about EPT CL: He said, that did not want to make excuses and thinks the program is a blessing. He said it upsets him that he's been delinquent because of outside circumstances. His Aunt was diagnosed with cancer and it's upset him. He spoke with coaches and understands hes on the last straw. He is genuinely scared and hopes that its not too late; believes hes good at this and has been a little distracted. He definitely understood his next steps and was very intent on meeting expectations this week and passing the program. He did not question any of the concerns.

It is with great regret that I am contacting you with notification of my withdrawal from the upcoming September 2016 cohort. Since I initially accepted the offer, a few personal circumstances have arisen for me that make it impossible for me to uphold a rigorous schedule of this nature at the current time. I feel that, for the sake of the students I would be working with, it is only right to finalize my enrollment if I can fully commit to being at my best. Please accept my sincerest apologies; I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to be selected for such a prestigious program. I am hopeful that I can remain a candidate for reapplication in future cohorts, as I would love to be a part of NYCTF when conditions are more favorable for success. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

I have always been an empathetic person who believes strongly in others, and having grown up poor in Brooklyn, attending public school, and with socioeconomic and class issues have always been close to my heart. In addition to my Spanish literature B.A., I was one course short of a Sociology B.A. (it became a minor instead), with a focus on urban sociology, race, gender, and class.  

After years of working steadily, showing reliability and strength, coupled with learning and growing, I am a stronger, much more confident person. I believe any child can learn, that schools matter, and even having more minority teachers and those with experience like mine, of poverty, bullying, and personal obstacles, can be the most encouraging and effective.

I believe that the NYCTF program is an excellent program that provides professionals an opportunity to fast track their teaching career.  One of the factors that motivated me to reapply to this program is because I have an unwavered desire to become a teacher.  Additionally, I gained priceless experience working with NYC Administration for Childrens Services.  The experience  I gained while working in the challenging position of Child Protection Specialist gave me the drive and confidence in knowing that I am an even stronger candidate than the last time I applied

Natalie listened and remained professional on the call but did express some resistance and did not feel as though these issues had been addressed with her by her TA staff. She provided more context, and when I thanked her for that but reminded her that these issues were not up for debate at this time, she did reply, ""well, if they aren't up for debate, what's the point?"" She ended the call on a more professional note and I did make clear that she is welcome to reach out and will have my contact information in the EPT letter for reference. 

",Professionalism,PST Concerns,"Natalie called in expressing concerns at her TA. 
- She is teaching 8th grade math and is not comfortable with teaching Math - she says that she expressed these concerns to her Coach and TAD from the beginning of the summer, but has received limited support and because of this feels she hasn't improved throughout the summer (she is also on a PIP).
- She feels there is confusion over which curriculum she needs to be following while in the classroom. 
- The principal of the school has observed her several times throughout the summer. 
-Today (7/25) while teaching the classroom the principal of the school was observing her and in front of the class yelled at her for what she was teaching the students. 
- Her TAD and coach were meeting with the principal today following this incident. 
- Natalie has asked about withdrawing due to all points expressed above.

One reason in particular is because I wanted to make an impact in the young community. I am the type of person that pushes myself to new levels and rises to meet new challenges. Any obstacle that is put forth I always over come them and anytime there is a problem Im always the first to brainstorm ideas to solve the task at hand. In addition, when I did not get accepted the first time around that motivated me to reapply because I strongly believe I am fit for the program. My leadership skills and my determination are highly advanced and I believe that I am capable enough to teach this young generation and to guide them to an excellent education and a very bright future.

In 2009, I received a Master of Public Health degree in the Community Health Education track from Hunter College. For two years between 2008 and 2010, I led a health education project for high school students under a Hunter College/NYC Department of Health contract. My professional goal since this contract ended was to continue to teach health education to high school students. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find employment in this area despite attempts to do so, and the experiences I've had with my 3 most recent jobs that have not involved classroom teaching highlight the need for me to directly pursue the training and credentials to teach. 

I was informed that I may have been rejected from the Teaching Fellows program with a Science preference in 2010-11 because I did not have adequate science credits from one single science department. What makes me a stronger candidate now is that I am presently applying with a Special Education preference and my recent experience being a mother of two children with special needs. Both my children attend NYC DOE elementary schools, have IEPs, and have assigned paraprofessionals. Not only do I have years of hands-on experience working closely with my children with learning needs, I have an insider's understanding of what Special Education is, the process involved for parents, teachers, and schools, and a deep appreciation for how it can profoundly serve a student's education. I have seen best practices at work with the Special Education programs that my children receive at their school and I am personally committed to extend the benefit to the many other students who need it.",5/27/1987,no,,,,,,no,Accept,Accept,Special Education,2/16/1965,12/28/2015,Highly Recommend,0,Referral,"Hi Shauna--

I had just been promoted from a floor level customer service supervisory position at Cach Inc. to a role overseeing a team of approximately fifty agents serving us through a third party vendor, as well as an in-house team of nine e-commerce and IT Helpdesk agents. Additionally, I had taken on responsibility for the highest-profile or most sensitive client concerns escalated from our 235 store locations or our e-commerce business, including complaints escalated to our executive team, or received through the Better Business Bureau.
 
However, in February of 2015, Cach Inc. filed for bankruptcy, and in March commenced liquidation proceedings. Our remote customer service vendor immediately canceled our contract, leaving us with no-one to answer the hundreds of inquiries we were receiving daily. I improvised - since we were too short-staffed to receive calls directly, I suggested that we create an in-house email inbox for customer emails, and import unanswered emails from our former vendor to be answered by our team. I quickly trained 2 employees from other departments and created a series of templates for our most common inquiries.  We were able to clear a backlog of roughly 2000 emails within days, allowing us to resolve the majority of our customer's concerns before closing our doors for good. When we lost our returns processing vendor shortly after our customer service partner, we re-routed pending returns to our home offices and improvised a return process to ensure that our customers were reimbursed for their returned items, and that the inventory received could be redistributed to our stores for liquidation sales. It seemed each day we lost business-critical partners, and were required to improvise solutions, all the while working  with an incomplete order management system and a skeleton crew.

I learned in that hectic time that even with limited preparation, I am able to make a positive impact by maintaining an attitude of adaptability and receptiveness. The Teaching Fellows program requires this attitude; in a matter of months, prospective teachers are required to absorb what it takes most years to learn. My experiences have prepared me to face that challenge.

When I was young, I dreamed of being a teacher. I would record my lesson plans in a composition book, and would practice with my stuffed animals using the chalkboard my parents had set up in the garage, then as I grew older, with my cousins as my pupils. As I grew older, I began to put that dream aside. Teachers don't make enough money, I thought, for the amount of work they do, and the difficulty of it. I pursued instead a career in customer service, where I was promoted quickly and paid accordingly. However, when Cach filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors, I took it as a crossroads, a call to re-evaluate my career path. What I realized was that I needed more than money; I needed a career that would allow me to make a meaningful contribution to the world around me every day. This is what led me to dust off that old dream of becoming a teacher, because teachers are on the front lines of addressing the very root on inequity, and it is difficult to imagine a more compelling contribution to society.

I do regret to advise that I have resigned my position at the Urban Assembly Academy for Future Leaders, and am leaving the Teaching Fellows.

I have sincerely appreciated your expert advice and support, and wish you all the best for 2017 and beyond. 


Kindest Regards 

Jhonelle A. Johnson

Hi Mallory,

Could you share the name so that we can be sure to alert anyone who might freak out about the absence? Because of the tight scheduling and absence policy, there is a chance that people will be have an OMG reaction to his absence. 

Thanks!

Hi Mallory,

If they are denied security clearance, they are withdrawn from the Program. Since theyre no longer part of the program, they do not receive stipends moving forward. 

Whos the Fellow thats been postponing meeting with you to go to training? We can give him special permission to miss training to meet with your team. 

And yes, everyone is conditional on continuing in the program since security check is essential for their access in working with our kids. If they cant work with our kids, theyre missing a crucial part of training and thus will not successfully complete training. 

Thanks!

So, if they are denied security clearance how do you pay them?  

We have a specific case where the person is not likely to be granted security clearance.  The applicant has been postponing meeting with us to attend training.  If hes denied, arent you exposed on your end?

I was just concerned that it might be setting up in issue down the line.

We will keep your timeline in mind if we get more TFs.  From below, it sounds like your applicants are on notice that all is conditional.

Thanks,
Mallory

Subject: RE: TF training this week?

Hi Mallory,

Thanks for your proactivity and putting this at the forefront. Fellows pre-service training (PST) began this week. They are in coursework all morning and afternoon, and then in NYCTF training sessions in the evening. They have a tight schedule and cannot miss any aspects of training. If they need to be down here for an appointment, we should be able to make an exception to miss a part of coursework, which ends around 3 or 4pm. 

If Fellows are not provided security clearance by the start of summer school, we do not let them start working in summer schools (their field experience of training). If they have not cleared within the first 2-3 days of summer school, we withdraw them from the program and provide the option of a deferral to the next years cohort, pending that they clear background checks. If they do not pass background, they cannot join next years cohort. 

So given that summer school starts on 7/7 this year, we would give them to the end of the week (7/8) to gain security clearance, so we can let them know whether to report or not to summer school the following Monday, 7/11. Does that timeline work for your team? 

Thanks!
Nuree

Good morning Nuree,
Is there TF training this week that candidates are required to attend?

If a candidate has not completed the background investigation, and has not been granted security clearance, are you holding back on training?  I see potential problems if they complete training and then are denied the security clearance, which is a foreseeable outcome.  

Let us know.

Thanks,
Mallory

Subject: ATTENDANCE AND RATINGS Sharon Lee

Hi Meha, 
Sharon left our site at 11AM today because she had to go to the ER as asvised by her DR. She was having hernia pain. 

My coach could not observe her since she missed her teaching time and therefore cant enter diagnostic ratings. Please let me know if anything further needs to be done about her diagnostic ratings ( i told her not to submit anything). Additionally, does this count as an absence from SBS as well as a lateness because she left early from FDT? 

Please advise

I had just graduated from college and was exploring my career options. Teaching was a secondary prospect as my primary goal was to work in college administration, which is also the graduate degree I would eventually pursue. After achieving my professional goals, I became dissatisfied with the work I was doing and decided to pursue a career in teaching. Seven years later, after working for a non-profit organization that catered to underprivileged children, learning about the deficiencies of the American school system in my Masters program and seeing how it affects their potential for success in postsecondary education while working in college admissions, I am a stronger applicant. I am stronger because I am much ore dedicated to the field of education, I am more mature, and I have much more work experience than I did when I initially applied.  I believe that I have the professional background and the academic foundation to serve the student population of New York City in realizing their potential for academic success.",5/14/2008,yes,,,,,,no,Accept,Accept,Special Education - Bilingual,1/12/1986,1/5/2016,Recommend with Confidence,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had enough and officially withdrew today. What prompted me to withdraw was the two hour commute to the summer school academy. However, that was not the worst part. I was placed in an academy teaching third grade when my license is for 7-12. I really think that there is a huge difference between teaching high school and third graders and felt that I would not be adequately prepared for teaching in September. Additionally, when I contacted the fellows office, I saw that no one cared or bothered to respond to me. I called everyday for three days and everyday I was promised that someone would get back to me and address my concern. I really feel like crap, but I had to do what I felt was right.

I would like to say farewell to all the great people I met in this program and I wish you all the best.",None,withdrawal,"Called in on 7/13 to request withdrawal from the program, stating the commute was too much and he was unhappy with his Training Academy. He stated that his assigned grade levels were 7-12 but he was working with third graders at his TA. Additionally, he stated that there were only six students in the classroom and that he didn't feel like he was ""doing anything"" while there. In regard to the commute from his TA to his university, I mentioned that he was excused early in order to arrive at his university on time - to which he expressed frustration because he did not want to have to leave his TA early.

Subject: RE: Katherine Alvarez

Hi Marie,

Thanks for looping back on Katherine Alvarez. Ive added the email thread I had with an HRD who contacted the Fellow in issue logs. 

She just had twin babies last month, and had not secured a job before that. She does have until January to secure a position so I would follow up with her to see what her plans are. We cant withdraw her now since she has the January deadline. Shes a SPED Bilingual LIU Fellow, so Im also curious to see if shes enrolled in coursework or taking the semester off, and if taking the semester offthis is a tricky one because she should have technically been enrolled in coursework even if she wasnt working this semester because of the January job search deadline. 

Charlene  would you follow up with Neil at LIU to see if Katherine is enrolled in coursework or if shes taking the semester off and if that was approved by the university? 

CC-ing Sarah and Erika as FYIs, and in the case they need to weigh in sometime soon. 

Thanks,
Nuree

Hi Jerry:
 
The Teaching Fellows have responded in providing us the resume of a Fellow who is Bilingual Special Education and who has not obtained a position as yet.  
 
The candidate should be contacted as soon as possible for an interview and if you are interested, they can be staffed as a Long Term Sub (5BA) until they have completed their exam requirements.  
 
Should you decide to hire, ask the candidate for a copy of their TF Commitment Form, which should be completed and signed by you and the Fellow confirming the position has been offered and taken.  Make a copy for your records and the student will scan a copy to Central, so that the Fellows program is aware of the hire.  You can then intend them into a position in Galaxy.
 
I will contact the candidate to let them know of your possible interest and that you will be reaching out to them soon.
 
Thanks

Hi Ovella, 
 
The Fellows team let me know we have one more SPED Bilingual Fellow, Katherine Alvarez, who hasnt yet secured a position. Im attaching her most recent resume (from her New Teacher Application).
 
Additionally, we may have one traditional routed candidate who is certified for SPED Bilingual and has expressed interest in applying to the DOE. We are reaching out to her. 
 
Lastly, while we have closed the application for our Subsidized Bilingual Extension Program for this year, we do have an UNSUBSIDIZED bilingual extension protocol for current teachers and principals to sign, which would allow the teacher to be teaching in a bilingual setting with the supplementary extension while they work towards a bilingual extension. Its essentially a signed agreement between the teacher and principal that states that the teacher will work towards the extension over a set period of time. Let me know if the school has a SPED teacher who is fluent in the language and would be interested in this option.

Hi Vicky:
 
I hope all is well you.
 
I need your help on an urgent matter.  One of my schools, 24Q143 needs to find a bilingual Spanish Special Education Teacher for a vacancy that was created as a result of a parent complaint reported to the Deputy Chancellor Office. Per the school and the below email from the D#24 PLF, the Deputy Chancellor for SPED is watching this matter closely.
 
Are there any current Bilingual Programs or new registration of Teaching Fellows that may be able to fit this request.  As you may already be aware, finding a bilingual (Spanish ) Special Ed is a bit challenging this late in the school year. I am open to any ideas that you may have.
 
Thanks

Although I teach English composition courses as a part time college instructor I enjoy working with traditional and non-traditional students.  When I first applied to the Teaching Fellows I was unsure of myself.  I didn't think I would be able to make a difference in a student's life.  I believed that I was too introverted to teach although I love the arts and have performed my spoken word pieces (and transformed into characters) in front of an audience.  I honed my teaching and classroom management skills for two years at Delaware County Community College in Media, Pennsylvania.  I taught composition, creative writing and remedial English classes to adult and incoming traditional freshman students. In order for me to become a better instructor I solicited help from fellow instructors and former graduate cohorts who were also instructors.  I developed my syllabus days in advance and asked for feedback.  I practiced and developed my ""speaking voice"" so as not to appear nervous and decided to walk around the classroom instead of remaining in one place. Part of my classroom management development was incorporating student input when constructing rules for the classroom.  I developed three non-negotiable rules and asked students to contribute to the next three rules.  I used technology in the classroom such as MS Word and a projector so that my learners (auditory, visual, analytical, etc) could ""see"" the sentence we were developing in composition courses.  I also used the SMART boards that were provided in each of the classrooms. In my creative writing classes we read poems for example and then listened to the author read his or her piece. I brought in literary articles about said author and taught lessons concerning analyzing passages and interpreting concepts. I asked students for feedback concerning content and became transparent, meaning in my introduction I shared my background, education, goals, strengths and weaknesses (being shy).  I explained to my students that I enjoy group work and will help them as long as it is a mutual agreement.  We worked as a group throughout the semester.  

There were days when I didn't think I was reaching my students and felt overwhelmed but I continued to challenge myself to do better one day at a time.  The end result was a humbling yet empowering experience.  My students passed the courses, recommended their friends to take my classes and wrote positive notes about my teaching style.  This helped confirm that I understood the content and could impart what I knew to students! My students, in turn, made gain.  Students were comfortable with their writing skills and noticed progression in their pieces and essays.  In other words, students who were initially writing one-paragraph responses were able to develop three to five paragraph responses.  Some students whose vocabulary were limited in the beginning of the semester slightly increased.  Students were writing essay responses from a positive perspective as opposed to thinking of assignments as tasks.  

Since then, I have worked with at-risk students, taught more composition courses in New York City at CUNY (City University of New York) colleges.  I continue to receive positive affirmations from my students.  I continue to discuss ideas with my graduate cohort and colleagues.  I decided to try again because I am a successful product of the New York City Public School system.  I had teachers and principals who instilled the notion of excellence.  They taught me to set goals and work hard to attain them.  As a product of the New York City public school system I believe it is my obligation to pay it forward by sharing what I have obtained.  I have taken what I learned as a child and empowered my students.  

I have taught various students: traditional, non-traditional, ELL learners, students with various disabilities from various socio-economic backgrounds and I share the same thoughts with all of them, ""We try our best in this class.  We do not say that we cannot do something because that is why we are here.  We will learn from each other and together, we will get through this semester/year.  All I ask is that you try.""  At first my students think that I am using cliche sayings but they realize that I am serious about education and their well-being and in turn, they work hard.  If given another opportunity, my goal is to bring all of my experiences attained since my last application to help middle or high school attain their academic and personal goals.

I have not had the time to complete everything that I needed to up to this date and I definitely do not want to start behind. This is a time in particular when I feel I wouldn't be able to give my all to my classwork because of other things that are happening, therefore I would like to request to withdraw from the program at this time, with the hopes of being able to reapply later on to next year's. 

If you would please let me know if there is anything else that I need to do or complete to make my withdrawal official i would really appreciate it. 

Thank you so very much and my best wishes to all the new fellows.

Sincerely,

Hello,

Sorry for not being transparent these last couple of weeks, I have decided to leave the program. The Fellows isn't the right fit for me. I'd much rather learn and master the art of teacher before diving into a classroom without the necessary tools. I also felt that when I did give my best in the class it wasn't paying off and I felt that I was wasting my time trying to get a D or C in this class. I am fine with a UW for the semester or whatever you deem fit but I would like to let you know that I won't be finishing out the semester at Hunter for those reasons as well as medical reasons. You made your class very informative and it was truly appreciated!

Thank you,
J'naya Marville

Hi J'naya-

You did not attend today's course which was the presentation of your final project, the Choose It, Try It, Share It assignment. I also noticed that you have not completed work, including two summative assessments for the phonics segment of our class, in the last three weeks. I want to check in with what's happening with you. 

Please contact me as soon as possible.

",University,follow up on resignation,"Hi J'Naya,

Thank you for your message.

As you can see on your Fellow Commitment Form, once you resign from your teaching position, you are no longer eligible to remain in the Teaching Fellows program. Unfortunately, this is not something that we are able to reconsider. Can you please let us know your last day you are teaching in the position?

If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out via the Contact Form.

Best,
Heather

to me 
Hi,


I was not given any other options by anyone from the Fellows office and I have an extreme medical condition. No one from the office gave me any guidance with what to do and this was all I was able to do in terms of leaving an environment that was dangerous for me. If there is a way I can come in and speak with someone I definitely will because this was not something anyone was willing to help me with. I do not feel comfortable giving any further information until I am given an appointment with someone that is able to hear my concern, preferably someone that will take my extreme medical condition into consideration. 


Thank you,

J'naya Marville

Hi J'Naya,

Thank you for reaching back out.

We are sorry to hear about your medical condition. As you mentioned in your previous message, we provided you with information on how to take leave and explained that the decision to grant your leave is made by your school and university. As was discussed, NYCTF is only able to grant leave if your university and school do so and we are not able to make an exception to this rule - you must be in good standing with your university and have a full-time position in order to remain in the Fellows program. Since you resigned from your school, you unfortunately are no longer eligible to remain in the Fellows program. 

If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out via the Contact Form.

Best,
Heather

Heather",Withdrawal,resignation from school,"""Hi, I called the office a couple of weeks back because I have decided to take next semester off because of a medical concern. I described my situation to them and they seemed to understand my situation and told me to ask about options with my university and my school. My principal is not the most supportive person when it comes to teachers taking breaks and it was not going well for me, I felt they were finding any way to write me up and I felt the only way I could leave was to resign. I read that if I resign from my position then i resign from the program but I wanted to know if I can state my case and give proof of my medical condition would there be reconsideration?Thank you""

We replied informing J'Naya that since she resigned from her position, she is no longer eligible to remain in the Fellows program. We asked that she let us know the last day she will be teaching.

",Pre-Service Training,Issued EPT CL,"I called Jnaya to issue an EPT CL and left a message. She called me back and I began to go through the talking points, explaining the issues we've seen with the EPTs (professionalism/high expectations). She immediately interrupted and asked, ""do I need a lawyer or something like that?"" I explained that we were just giving her a set of next steps and she needed to follow these next steps through the completion of the program. She said that she was not going to do any extra work and indicated that she was upset that she was not receiving an email from anyone in the office that she was approved to start teaching. She said she submitted a form last week. She said, ""If were going to talk about professionalism right now, then your office needs to be professional, you'll have to pay me or something because I can't accommodate that right now."" She then went on to explain that she already paid for a trip and that she wasn't going to do any more work. I explained that this was not extra work, but merely meeting expectations. She said she has not received word about this until today. I reiterated a few times throughout this conversation that we needed to discuss next steps and she continued to go on about the concerns. I was able to explain her next steps (I focused on the others and left out unprofessional dress). Before I got to the job search part, she said, ""We dont have a consistent co-teacher and it changed from yesterday to today."" She said she has already been doing these things: ""I've been doing it so far"" and said she would to read the letter with an attorney present and that she will go get a friend whose a lawyer from the South to come up here. She claimed this was ""Slander"" and that she would be getting a lawyer.  I didn't have the chance to go through the job search part (she already has a job) and did my best to end the call as soon as possible as she continued to speak rudely, inappropriately, accusingly, and remark that she would be getting a lawyer. At some point, she also said she wanted to speak to someone higher up at the office and I explained that we would have no additional information for her and that as long as she was able to meet the expectations of the EPTs, she would be able to complete the program.

Traveling made me realize just how small I am in the grand scheme of things and that I live in a world where everything and everyone is interconnected.  This realization helped me grow exponentially as an individual and as a professional.  Ultimately, I can say with the utmost confidence that traveling is the best education I received.  

What made traveling the best education for me was not just experiencing all the beautiful and majestic things in life but it was also being exposed to the bad and ugly things in the world.  I experienced and saw the evilness in people when they are pushed to a corner in their lives.  I saw how easy people lose track of their humanity in exchange for money.  This set of experiences was not easy to take in, and it certainly made me think twice of what I was doing, but I have never felt more alive than I did when I was traveling so I kept moving forward.  It was only until after the second anniversary of traveling that I realized that the bad and the ugly were probably the best lessons I can learn from in life and I did just that, and it led to my continued growth.  

I think being exposed to the world is the best education for any of these students in low-income communities.  I remembered the epiphany I experience when I first traveled, when I realized that the world was so big and so is my potential to make an impact on people.  Many of these students, similar to myself at their age, lack ambitions and inspirations because they are expose to very little in life and therefore their imagination is also limited.  I am ready to become an educator, and a mentor.  ",6/1/2010,no,,,,,,no,Accept,Accept,English as a Second Language,5/21/1985,1/4/2016,Recommend,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",None,P's concerns about F performance,"Principal has concerns about Fellow's organization and student engagement skills. Principal stated that students line up outside the classroom before class begins, and instead of bringing the kids in within a few minutes of the period starting, Fellow takes between 5 to 10 minutes to get her students in the classroom. Additionally, the principal noted that the Fellow's lessons are not engaging, and students are bored in class, which leads to disruptions. Fellow has also been provided feedback to run through labs before doing them with students. She has been noted to be heard saying something along the lines of, ""Let's go through the directions. I haven't done this myself yet."" Principal has shared that the Fellow's school-appointed mentor is a master teacher with Math for America, and also has the AP visiting for weekly observations and feedback.

Immediate next steps: I emailed Charlene to find out who the Field Consultant is for this Fellow, and the contact info so that the Principal can reach out to the FC to work collaboratively in supporting the Fellow.

Hi Lauren, 

Thank you for reaching out. I've made a note of this in our records and your first stipend check will not be upheld due to the testing registration. 

Please keep in mind that your university is a large factor in your Training Academy placement, your borough preference isn't taken into consideration for this assignment. 

So glad you've enjoyed the start of your PST. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out via the Contact Form!

Hello. I am responding to the recent message regarding checklist items that are not yet completed- my NY State Certification Exams. I am writing to update you and let you know that I took my EAS this past weekend as scheduled. I am registered and scheduled to take the Biology 006 CST on July 2nd, and  the ALST on July 9th. As I told Maggie when I discussed this in person with her at the Teaching Fellows office, these dates are the soonest I was able to register for the exams with an accommodation for extended time on the exams. I scheduled them on weekends to avoid having to miss any training time during the week. I am meeting all other requirements for the fellowship program, and I hope that my first stipend check will not be held up because of this. Maggie also said to include in the contact form that I have taken a dorm room in the Brooklyn College dorm for the summer. I am not changing my address with you because I will be commuting in from NJ during the school year. Because I am living in Brooklyn for the summer, and attending ny graduate classes at Brooklyn College, I ask that you please place me for field training at a site in Brooklyn or in Manhattan if possible, and not at a site in the Bronx. I had originally listed the Bronx as my borough choice, but since I have been placed at Brooklyn College, I definitely need to change that to Brooklyn. It takes an hour to get from Penn Station to Brooklyn College on the subway. I would be very concerned about getting from a school in the Bronx over to Brooklyn College in time for class in the afternoon during summer training. Thank you again for switching me over to Brooklyn College, it seems like a great program and is a much better fit for me with the in-person coursework. On the first exam in my Biology Immersion class I got a 95.It has been exciting to begin PST this week! Thank you very much. -Lauren L. Garber",Pre-Service Training,,,,,,

Hi Orit,

Forgive me if this is the wrong contact info but found your contact info based on what I know about my roommate's schooling...

I'd like to contact you in regards to Derek Herzer, a student of your program. He claims to be taking classes through you all and teaching/taught math at your schools Bronx river high school and PS middle school 206 Jose Celso Barbosa through the NYC Teaching Fellows program... Not sure if he's going back in rotation or classes but I was his roommate for the past three months and should've contacted you earlier.

He has a drug and alcohol problem and goes on benders making it a living hell for my roommates and I. We've almost evicted him but the lease was almost up so sucked it up. I had to call security on him last night when he was supposed to have moved out of our apartment that day with the lease being up. He had gone on a bender and was incoherent high/drunk and making no sense with a disaster of a room: alcohol and drugs everywhere, furniture still there in no attempts to have moved. They took him to the hospital but this isn't the first time he had to go to the hospital from being too intoxicated while living under our roof.

I feel very strongly that he should not be teaching the next generation of youth or even be around children. Please call me if you have any questions 4042165389 or email me at daniellegadams@gmail.com I have photo/video evidence as well. But if you contact him about this, please leave my name out of this and reference me as an anonymous source because I don't want him to track me down at my new apartment and threaten me.

Thank you,

Hi team,

A school wants to hire C27 Fellow Faith Lee but it sounds like the principal hasnt been able to reach her/hasnt heard from her since Tuesday. Given that hiring is happening quickly at this point to fill vacancies ASAP, could someone reach out and see what is the dealio? 

She doesnt have another offer  at least I dont think she does because shes not appearing on Galaxy at all. 

Thanks,

Hi Sharie,
I interviewed Faith Lee last week from the Teaching Fellows for the ESL position. I called her today to offer her a position and have not heard back from her. I hope she is okay. Do you have a contact in the NYCTF office that can reach her or check on her? She appeared to be interested when I last spoke with her on Friday. I dont mind if she doesnt want to accept the job but I would hope to hear from her in some capacity. 

Best,
Melissa

Subject: RE: Teaching Fellow R. Ruggiero - F-status?

Hello Yvette,

We hired Robert as a four day a week  F status because we are rolling admissions and are uncertain of the ability to support full time until we see what intake is.   This is not a new process for us.  Last year we also  hired a fellow as F status and there were no issues with it.   ( FYI- her position rolled into  a full time position  once we were able to fill the program)  Also,  prior information we received indicated that fellows have until January to be in full time positions.

Hello Melody,

The fellows office see that you hire the above fellow as F-status and wanted to know if you can share the reason why you hired as part-time F-status and not a full time position.  I think in might jeopardize their fellows program status; I have no idea.  Let me know the reason and I will see if this is acceptable for the program.

Hi Yvette,

Happy first day of school! Hope its been a great day so far for you and your team. 

Im writing today to inquire about the hiring status of one of our Teaching Fellows, Robert Ruggiero, at 02M394 (Emma Lazarus HS). He is hired as F-status. Do you know why that is? We usually do not have Fellows hired as F-status but either as fully appointed teachers or a long-term sub under the 5BA status. 

Thank you,
Nuree

Hello Mr Napoli, 

I'm one of the teaching fellows at St. John's (Special Education/English).  I believe my field consultant Mr. Buckman reached out to you in expressing his concern for my situation this semester.  I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer a month ago and I wanted to wait for a more comprehensive idea of what was going to happen from my doctors before reaching out to you. So far, the diagnosis seems to have a mostly positive outlook and I'll be undergoing surgery on December 21st to nip it in the bud. I scheduled this before winter break so that it will hopefully cause minimal interference with both school and work. At this point I'm being told that the most likely scenario will be that I will be able to return after a week or two of recovery. I will speak to my professor (Mr. Pinsky) about make up assignments and so forth (he's not aware of what's going on because I wanted to speak with you first), but as of now I am hoping to continue this semester unless something goes awry and I'll have to take more time off than anticipated. I just wanted to make you aware of my situation and see how you'd like me to proceed. I can provide medical documents to St. John's  if needed. Thanks for your time. 


Best Regards, 
Cassandra Jurska

This is the email from RelayGSE

Hello, Jing,
 
I hope this email finds you well.
 
Because your undergraduate GPA is below our 2.75 minimum, you are not eligible to enroll in Relay as a matriculated student. Rather, should you receive an offer of admissions, you are only eligible to enroll in Relay as a non-matriculated student. There are significant academic, financial and administrative implications to being a non-matriculated student, considering you will not be earning credit , working towards a degree, nor eligible for certification.  Please read the attached document very carefully as  it summarizes those implications. After reading this document, please let us know if you have any questions. We are happy to help.
 
Best,
Medgina""""""",University,,,,,,,,,,,,

Good Morning,

I do apologize for my late response. I woke up on the 5th feeling completely horrible and the feeling persisted until today. Today, I also have my certification exam so I did not want to put too much on my plate. I look forward to future tours.

Thanks,

****First of all, I would love to help you.  Can I make an endorsement first: I hope that my recommendation for the special education Teaching Fellows for the upcoming cohort, Christopher Adamec, is among those selected.  He is a former student of mine here in NYC and would be an excellent addition to the Fellows program and the NYCDOE.****

To answer your question regarding space, I will have our business manager, Chad Hudson (copied here) confirm these dates to see if the auditorium is open (the cafeteria is being renovated so it is out) but if it is available you certainly can have it.  I will warn you though, it is not a glamorous auditorium.  It is rather outdated, BUT it is certainly functional and we can provide a microphone.  You may want to see it first, however, before you decide.  You are welcome to come here anytime.

I have four current Fellows on staff here, not to mention all of those who were former Fellows, so I am happy to support whenever I am able.

Best regards,

Larry

Got it. Thanks, Colin. Were going to withdraw her since shes not guaranteed clearance at this point and will be missing a huge chunk of training if shes not allowed to be in the classroom this summer. 

We will be offering her to defer to next years cohort, pending her clearance status. If she clears, she will be deferred to next years cohort. If she doesnt clear, then she wont be able to join the Fellows program. 

Thank you! I appreciate your updates.

He disputed one of his absences on 7/8 and said he was definitely at SBS that day. I told him to speak to his LI about it.
He also explained that he was 30 mins late on the first day of FE as he is new to New York and could not figure out how to get there. He missed PST on 7/20 to attend an orientation at the school that has hired him. I explained our policy for school based PDs and orientations and he said he told his Coach so didn't think he needed to inform the front office. He was clearly upset as Lauren had called him the day before about a PCL (which he brought up) and said he didn't understand why he was constantly being reprimanded and that this 'whole situation was beyond him'. He also said that all these mistakes in attendance were ""ludicrous"" as there were many Fellows who arrived after him but were not marked absent. He said he did everything he was supposed to and foudn that nothing was good enough and that he was being reprimanded constantly. I explained that the purpose of my call was not to reprimand him but to remind him of our attendance policy and expectations and to check-in with him. He then calmed down and said that he was sorry and realized that my tone was polite and I was not reprimanding him. I encouraged him to reach out to his LI about attendance on 7/8 as he claims he was present.  ",Pre-Service Training,Attendance,Called Neil to follow up about his absences -- he is now at three absences. He did not pick up so left a VM. ,Pre-Service Training,Issued EPT CL,Spoke with Neil to issue an EPT CL. He said he understood the next steps; he disputed one of the incidents (07/08) and said he already had a job lined up.

I really want to give back, and help some of the people in this country that need it the most. At the same time, I love teaching and school in general. I feel I belong in the classroom, and if that is going to be my career I want to put my effort in where I am needed most.
I am more serious about this program since I last applied. I will do whatever it takes to get myself into a teaching position at a high-need school, so I can pour my heart out into helping and inspiring the next generation. Specifically my wonderful cousin who teaches Special Education has inspired me to try to pursue teaching students with special needs. I want the sense of fulfillment she feels at the end of each work day, but more so I want to inspire these young minds and have them know that anything they dream of is possible.

I was also torn by the opportunity to teach internationally overseas and utilize my recently earned graduate degree in International Education. I believed the opportunity to pursue teaching internationally would satisfy both my interest in education and working with culturally diverse people from different backgrounds. I realized teach teaching ESL could both satisfy my passion for cross-cultural interaction, while serving a very real need in cities such as NYC. Now that I am committed to pursuing a career in education, I am fully confident that this is the right step and subject area that fits my interests and will allow me to serve with a 100 percent commitment to the mission and goals of the program.

She was disappointed to learn the decision was not able to be appealed and came in with a lot of evidence she had collected, like student test scores from the end of summer school exams, letters of support from other Fellows she worked with and anecdotes from her cooperating teacher. We explained that the decision was final and that many of those items arent considered in her final decision. Anna brought the conversation back to the review process as described in the PST Handbook and made clear that the reason Erica was outplaced was because she didnt meet the bar for performance. 

Erica was professional and calm throughout the conversation. She was assertive about the outplacement decision feeling unfair after sacrificing so much to be a part of the program. We explained that the outplacement decision in her case did not have to do with challenging her dedication or commitment to the program, but was an issue of her not meeting our performance bar, not showing growth and not effectively applying feedback from her coaches. 

She continued to express dissatisfaction with the process of review and described feeling in the dark while the process was underway. Erica asked a number of questions like, what number passed the external review, what is the evidence that allows someone to pass the review as opposed to me and asked to be sent both her performance scores and a transcript of the meeting. We explained that there was not a transcript for the meeting and that we couldnt share the performance of the overall cohort. We also again referred to the different elements we assess in the holistic review and described that decisions for Fellows under review are made carefully on an individual basis. 

Erica shared some frustration about the coaching process. She mentioned that she was placed on a PIP in the last week of PST and was not able to find time with her coach to discuss. We asked if she had followed up with her TAD about this issue and she said she had but not received a response. Erica also asked to see comments from her Coach and TAD but we explained that we collect those in confidence. Erica added that she had a number of behavioral issues in her class, a classroom of more than 30 students and rarely had enough materials available to her like calculators and text books. Erica explained that even with those circumstances she felt as though she had done everything she could and was surprised that her TAD and Coach didnt agree. 

Erica shared that learning this news came as a surprise to her hiring principal as well. She feels as though she is left to scramble for a job after giving so much to the program and missing the mark by such a small margin. She is following up to email some of the documents she brought along to the contact form. In conclusion Erica shared that she felt the Fellows program put her in a very difficult position. She felt that, at the bare minimum, I could have more information about what the review process involves. It doesnt feel holistic. We ended by sharing some other teaching pathways she could consider and thanking her for coming in to talk.

Hey Marie  would you be able to reach out to Dorcas Miller and see if she is interested in a deferral to next year? You can see her issue log notes below. If so, would you add her to the spreadsheet and do all the wonderful follow-up that you usually do?

- Dorcas Miller: We will offer Dorcas a deferral (she is SPED) since she is absent due to childcare issues.  
o This was her issue log from 7/5: ""I am resubmitting this form as I have not received confirmation that it was received and I am receiving email that confirms this. I am having difficulty arranging for the care of my daughter. I am a single parent with no other family. The training time has been very difficult and I anticipate more complications throughout the coming year as the requirements to do this well will increase. There are other concerns I have for her well being and academic work. She is in a highly accelerated program, is just about 13, is preparing for the specialized hs test and has a lot to loose this year. As much as I have loved this program and aspire to the teaching profession, I am not able to jeopardized the success of my daughter. In hind-sight it would have been best for me to apply for next year. If there is any consideration that can be given me for applying again it would be highly appreciated.

Erika has also reached out to his school. ,Withdrawal,University - Did Not Attend,"Hi Julia, 

I already called him earlier today. He was unaware that he needed to be enrolled in coursework over the summer, so hasnt been attending the two summer sessions at Hunter or taken steps to enroll into Hunter at all. 

We told him that we will follow up with him on next steps, making it aware to him that he needed to be participating in coursework as a component of PST in order to remain in good standing with the program. 

We will need to follow up with Erika on next steps for Johnny.

James Krizan has resigned from his job. I assume this means he will be outplaced from the fellows. Please advise?

Hi Janet, 

I am updating you to let you know that I have resigned and my last day will be June 8th.

I went to the UFT and talked to my representative. She tried to convince the principal to let me stay to the end of the year but the principal said no.

I may look for work in a private school and I could rescind my resignation and work in the DOE, but I am going to start looking for work in the technology industry.

Thanks for working with me and helping me through a difficult year.

Hi Meha, 

Thats totally my fault, Im sorry. Way back  in June, I had an informal conversation with Relay about Richardo, and said that if they were comfortable and he was comfortable, we could make the switch. I never heard back about whether it was official, but clearly now it is. My apologies again. His switch is approved. Thanks for letting him know that hes good to go.

Subject: C27 Subject Area Change

Hi Charlene and Erika, 
Richardo Smith (Cohort 27 Fellow) came into the office today last week to let us know Relay had changed his subject area from Chemistry Immersion to Biology Immersion. He stated that Relay told him our office approved the switch but I dont see anything in his issue log. Our front office team wouldnt have approved this on their own so was wondering if we had any information from Relay? We told him that we would need to follow up with his university to confirm this information
Thanks!

Subject: Withdrawal

Dear Professor Napoli,

Hello. I hope all is well. I am writing to let you know that I have withdrawn from the NYC Teaching Fellows, and therefore, will not be able to complete my master's degree for education at St. John's University. Although unfortunate, I have decided to withdraw for health purposes. Thank you so much for your guidance and support during my time at St. John's. I wish you all the best.

Sincerely,
Terasa Yu
",University,potential withdrawal,"Teresa called today to request more information on the process of withdrawing from the program. She shared that she is feeling overwhelmed by teaching, and is not sure if she is ready to be a teacher at this time. When speaking, she was audibly anxious and upset. I directed her to resources who may be able to support her in her first year of teaching, and asked if she reached out to any of these resources for support. She said that she had not. I also reminded her that if she withdraws at this time, she would leave her students without a teacher, and encouraged her to seek out support from her mentor. I also provided her with information on withdrawing from the program.

She thanked me for the information and said that she would think about her decision.",Withdrawal,,,,,,

Subject: FW: Re: Fellows Hire 10X141

Hi Dana and Charlene,

I wanted to flag for you a Relay Biology C27 Fellow who has passed all her exams and has not yet had Relay submit a recommendation and verify her education in TEACH. She passed her exams early on but didnt apply for her cert until today. 

She also was offered a leave replacement position (5BA), which I advised the HRD that is not ideal but may be the offer that keeps her in the Fellows program given the job search deadline is approaching. She will need to find an appointed position for September. 

Charlene  could you follow up on Relay to see if they are aware of her situation and to see when they will submit the rec for her? 

Dana  can you follow up with the Fellow re: the position, her application, and what her story is? It would be important to explain to her what I wrote out above in the second paragraph. 

Thanks!
Nuree

P.S. I will issue log this thread.

Hi Denise, 

Shes a Biology Fellow. She can be hired as a leave replacement but thats not an ideal situation for her. Shes passed all her cert tests and needs to reach out to her university to submit a recommendation for her to the State. That and verification that shes enrolled in a state approved program are all thats missing. Shes going to be certified so while a leave replacement is not ideal, it might be the only option for her if she hasnt secured a position. She has until early Jan to meet the job search deadline for June 2016 Fellows. 

Best,
Nuree

Good Morning Nuree,

Is the following candidate apart of the Fellows program?

Heidi Stonier SS#060-50-8151

If so for what license?  I dont see anything in the State for her and a school was interested in hiring?  The school thats interested only wanted to hire as a sub assigned as a leave replacement.  Can that be done or is it only that they can be hired full-time?

Thank You,

",Job Search,Leave of Absence_University,"I spoke to the University Coordinator at Relay, David Jordan, and he is fine with Heidi taking a leave of absence. However, she must formally apply for this leave of absence with the school. Relay will be not recommending her for a Trans B until she is re-enrolled in course work for the spring semester and has secured a teaching position.",University,delayed job search,"Heidi called today to inquire about a delayed job search. She stated that she would not be able to obtain a job until November due to an urgent family matter. We discussed the deadline to obtain a position by (January) and that it was a firm deadline. She inquired about a deferral and I explained that it was not typically granted for Fellows who have completed PST. She asked if there would be positions available in November, and I shared that I could not confirm that. 

She asked if there was anything that she could do to get an extension on the January deadline, and I reiterated that she must have a position by January 13 in order to remain in the program. She said that she would remain in her coursework and seek out a job later, and expressed dissatisfaction that there were not additional options available. I recommended that she begin the job search as soon as she can and reminded her that our goal is for her to succeed in the program.",Job Search,Updated EPT CL,I called Heidi to let her know that I have updated her EPT CL to reflect her recent missed check-in. She is very understanding and is clearly working hard to get back on track. She shared that she has spoken with her coach since she received the EPT CL and believes she has really gotten it together. She also shared that missing the check-in was a miscommunication about rooms and she thought it had all been sorted out; she was under the impression that her coach understood the miscommunication and wasn't planning on reporting it.  ,Professionalism,Left two messages,I am trying to call Heidi to update her EPT CL. I left two voicemail messages and sent two email messages to set up a time.  ,Professionalism

 Hi, this is Anna Kelly calling from the NYC Teaching Fellows program. 
 I am reaching out because there are concerns about you exhibiting unprofessional behavior at the Welcoming Event on Friday.  
 Specifically, you used the hashtag #fellowsteach on your Twitter Feed along with an inappropriate message before the event began.  I understand that maybe you werent aware that this would appear on the screen, but I want to emphasize that this was an inappropriate communication and was visible to all Fellows attending the event, as well as the Chancellor and several potential hiring principals. 
 Its important that you remain professional throughout PST, which includes professional oral and written communication.  
 I want to ensure that you have really clear expectations going forward: Throughout PST, you must be professional in all interactions with staff, peers, and students, including social media communications.  

Meghan was apologetic and said the tweet has been taken down.
",Professionalism,Inappropriate Tweet at WE,"This Fellow posted an inappropriate Tweet on the Twitter Feed at the Welcome Event. @MeghanBarry11 wrote, ""BALLS BALLS BALLS!!! #D75 #fellowsteach.""",Professionalism,,,,,,,,,

Hi Charlene, 

Montrae called in today to say that he appealed his university dismissal and his appeal was granted. He forwarded the below communications from Hunter. Before we move forward with reinstating him into the Fellows program  can we confirm with Hunter that the below is accurate? 

Hopefully we can overturn his withdrawal soon so that he doesnt miss too much teaching time in between! 

Let me know if theres any other information that would be helpful!

I wish you well in your future endeavors.

",University,Issued EPT CL,"I spoke to Montrae about his professionalism throughout PST and his interactions with his Lead Instructor. He provided a lot of context about his lead instructor and shared that he really believed she was being dismissive and demeaning towards him. He believes he has been professional so far and has merely expressed concerns with the LI's tone and behavior during SBS. He also mentioned he had a position already. He was professional throughout the call, while still questioning the program and whether we were getting both sides of the story and following-up with the LI about her tone and behavior.

I want to get in this profession because when I see young kids all the time on the train and at my job, I think what are they thinking? How are their parents talking to them? I have been around children my whole life since I was 7. I have a proclivity to it that I can't ignore. I was 7 years old and I had a class of teddy bears that I taught subtraction to. I never thought as an adult that I could do it, since I'm naturally shy. I am a stronger candidate now because I have so much more to give than the last time I applied. I wanted to be accepted into teaching fellows, but I was shaky and unsure. I psyched myself out. I thought maybe I can, but I didn't feel a sense of confidence. Now, I have had so much life experience that has made more of a dynamic person. I have a job at an Allergy practice in Manhattan, and it taught me life skills that I think made me realize what my strengths are. I truly like being around the public. People have said that I radiate positivity which I am so thankful for, because it took so much personal growth to come to this stage in my life. My outlook on life is so much more different. I like to say that my life didn't get much easier in terms of all my personal struggles going on at once but my skills in dealing with them has. I want to share. I love children, because I remember being one as if it was yesterday. I had mentors who didn't give up on me. It's my turn and I want it.

Through my experiences at work I have become more social, stronger and less nervous in communicating my ideas to others. At the time of my last interview I did not have enough public speaking. Through my managerial experience and health services employment, I have learned to over challenges and become a leader when carrying out important tasks. My goals of becoming an educator have not changed. Even though I did not reapply right away I became involved in community awareness for health insurance and taking advantage of free educational programs. As a parent I value my education and would like for students to be better prepared than I was during my entry to college. I look back and analyze that I was not readily prepare for college level work when I initiated. Therefore I stumbled and struggled through college. However, I completed my bachelors degree in hopes of working with our next generation to better assist them in their opportunities of accomplishing there goals.

Hilarie, 

This morning my grandfather had to go to the hospital. He had a heart attack and I have been in the hospital. I dont know what this means for me but I had to make a choice and I guess I chose being with my family. I contacted Karen earlier when it happened I didnt know I was to contact more than her. Im sorry.

Thank you for your speedy response. I graduated with an English Major with no minor. I needed to choose a concentration and therefore chose Secondary Education. This being said, I only took some education classes as it was required for my major and graduation but I did not complete a program which created a pathway for teaching. I have never had a teaching job. I'm sorry for any type of misunderstanding. 

Please reconsider my application for your program.

Thank you,

I informed him that the check cannot be located, apologized for the inconvenience, and said that we would reprocess the check which can take up to a month. 

He then became very aggressive on the phone, swearing a few times, and insulting the program. He then said that he wanted to ""chew out [my] boss"" and I told him that if he would like to speak to a supervisor, I could set up a quick conversation. He then would not tell me what times he was available, and said that if he didn't talk to someone tomorrow (9/14) he would ""just need to come down there and pay a visit"" - I ended the call saying someone would give him a call on 9/14 in the afternoon.",Pre-Service Training,Leave Request ,"I called Jason on Friday July 22 to follow up on a message he had sent through the contact form requesting a week off from PST for marine training. 
He said the training was mandatory and had already tried to move it but was unsuccessful. I asked him if he would consider a deferral as he would be missing an important week of PST and he said he did not want to wait a year. 
I discussed this with Anna, Julia and Maureen and let him know that he would be able to take the last week off but would have to work with staff at his PST site to complete all observations and get in all his ratings within a week. He would also have to complete some independent self study for the SBS content he was missing. I let him know that we would extend his deadline for his online coursework which was due on August 12. 
He asked if he could still miss a day of Field Experience to go for an interview as he would like to interview with another school before leaving. I explained that he could not have any time during PST as he would have a lot of content to make up for the week he was missing. He asked for more specifics about the week of 7/25 and I let him know that someone would reach out to him once we worked out his schedule. 

",Pre-Service Training,Expectations call,"I spoke to Jason about expectations for his last week since he will be out on military leave. 
1. Will be observed at least 2 more times this week for formal observations. 
2. Coach will meet to plan schedule tomorrow, Tuesday. 
3. Reiterate that he is being held to the same expectation despite having one week less of PST.  
4. Cannot interview throughout this week since he needs to spend time practicing. 
He understood everything; he pushed back on interviews a bit but ultimately understood and said he would discuss with his university. ",Pre-Service Training,,,,,,

I am not only a stronger candidate than I was 5 years ago, I am a stronger person. I am less shy and more confidant than I was when I first applied. I have gained so much more experience working with high school students and I have a better understanding of the challenges that young people face. I have been working in television for almost a decade now and that makes me a strong role model for kids. I had a dream. I worked hard. I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish. Now I'm ready to pass on my love of learning and hard work ethic to the next generation. I want kids to see that you might grow up the child of a teen mom, getting public assistance, dealing with domestic problems but you can still do great things if you work hard. If I can achieve my dream of editing and producing work that is seen worldwide, why can't these kids?  They can and they will with the right support. I want to be there for them, so I am trying again.  I am nothing if not persistent.

I applied to the NYC Teaching Fellows program when I had recently graduated college and obtained a Bachelors degree. At the time, I was a young mother of a boy named Michael. Michael, who is now 11 years old and a 6th grade student has taught me, that the more involved I am in his studies, homework, and projects, the more he will excel and be motivated to obtain higher grades. My daughter Mia is 6 years old and is currently in first grade. She is very independent, wise and I continue to encourage her to keep striving for the Os (outstanding) in her report cards. When I first applied to NYC Teaching Fellows, I did it because I wanted to make a difference and transform lives. I felt strongly about education and knew that if I overcame any obstacles anyone can too. However, I was faced with a new challenge when my son was diagnosed with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. After the diagnosis, my life turned upside down and I feared that my son would be negatively labeled and not be able to receive the same education as his fellow classmates at the time. Those were my feelings until I educated myself. My son has developed into a smart, bright, and social pre-teenager. I have learned to be patient, tolerant, and most importantly very involved in his education. I understood, that the lack of involvement in his daily activities, not giving him the tools that he needs, and not being in constant communication with him and his teachers would affect his grades significantly. Together we work on school projects, homework assignments, and other areas where he requires support. I recognize that the connection that I have established with the school has helped him perform to his fullest potential. Having this experience as a mother serves to say that it makes me a much stronger candidate to share my knowledge, support and experience as how an involved parent can make a world of a difference.

So my family and I decided it would be expedient for me not to start the program then because the family situation would impact my commitment to the program. Now I have some stability, my child is doing well and in first grade. The passion that I had then to make positive impact in a child's life has not changed, so I hope I will be given a second chance to pursue what truly matter to me in life. My experience as a special needs parent has made me appreciate more the need to make an impact in a child's life one at a time.

She is required to attend the first session of SBS from 4:30-6:30, but is able to leave at that time. Below is the email she sent in.

I would like to recommend Jennifer Mastrogiovanni.  She is applying for Fellows.

Her mother is one of the principals I work with.  She is an amazing principal.  I meet her daughter on Tuesday and she seems equally amazing.

As of Tuesday she was still working on the application so she may not be in the system yet.

Let me know what I need to do to recommend her.

Thanks,

Mike

I was pretty far in the process but became discouraged because I didn't think I would be able to move to New York from Baltimore in time for the program to begin. Talking to many of my peers about this program and my own research led me to reapply. I believe that this would be a perfect opportunity for me to demonstrate my eagerness to teach and give back to the community. Knowing that I wanted to reapply, I took the necessary steps to ensure that no obstacles would prohibit me from committing to NYCTF. Although I still currently live in Baltimore, I'm now able to relocate to New York immediately when I need to which makes me a stronger candidate since I last applied. Also, at the time when I applied last year I wasn't as sure of the path I wanted to pursue, but life has led me to develop a stronger passion for special needs students. New York City Teaching Fellows has helped so many others like myself, and I know it can also help me. It provides an opportunity to enhance my education while also up starting my career. The program is geared towards helping the teachers they train as well as the student that will be taught by these teachers, which will ultimately make a positive impact on the community.",5/29/2015,yes,,,,,,no,Accept,Accept,Special Education,10/24/1991,2/25/2016,Recommend,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi All, 

Hope you get to enjoy the sunshine today.

I wanted to check in to see if there has been a decision made around Catherine yet. Is she officially dropped from Pace or will she be re-enrolled? If she is dropped, we will move forward with dismissing her from the program. 

Best,
Charlene

Dear Charlene,
We learned late this week that 2 of our TF 2017 students dropped:
Schelpat, Tyler  Biology 
Eriguchi, Catherine  Adolescent 

Both resigned their teaching positions and are therefore dropped from the Pace Teaching Fellows.
Best,

Dear Tristin and Trevor: 

Thank you so much for offering your support. Odette is looking forward to her phone interview this upcoming Tuesday, April 5. Im confident she will do well, but I want to make sure to voice my very strong support, since she is a remarkable person and candidate. 

Sincerely,
Myra

Dear Trevor, 

I know you're away this week, so I will loop back around with you about this next week, but in the meantime, per our conversation on Tuesday, I wanted to pass along this strong endorsement of potential new teaching fellow Odette Castaneda.  It is my understanding that Odette is passionate about SWD and is also bilingual in Spanish.  Although she may not have the required undergraduate credits in Spanish (so may not be an ideal candidate for the Spanish 7-12), I do believe she would be an excellent candidate for CCNY's SPED with the bilingual extension, bilingual childhood, or even TESOL, if she's able to pass out of the language requirement.  I believe we would be lucky to have her!  

I am putting you in touch via this email with a colleague from York University.  Myra has been Odette's professor and mentor and would welcome the opportunity to personally endorse Odette's application through whichever avenue is the most appropriate.  Please respond to Odette with next steps when you are back in the office next week, or she and I can get back in touch about next steps as well.

Thanks a lot for passing this information along to whoever needs to see it. Hope you have a great trip to Savannah, complete with some unforgettable she-crab soup.

Best,

Tristin

Dear Tristan,

Thank you for offering to support my student, Odette Castaneda, in her application to NYC Teaching Fellows.

Odette is a remarkable candidate on several fronts: she is a dedicated, dogged, and charismatic individual with demonstrated success working with children with special needs from underserved communities. She has faced several personal, academic, and professional hurdles (described in the attached letter), and has shown incredible resilience. Through our conversations, I have learned about her unwavering dedication to differentiated learning, children from low-income communities, and to teaching for NYC schools.

I am eager to see her transition to a school and program that will support her. Please let me know if there is any additional information I can provide.

Sincerely,

Myra Lotto, Ph.D.

I had helped her throughout her education and assisted her in classrooms reading and working with the children.  She felt at the time that I would be a good teacher and we both felt that the teaching career was a noble and rewarding endeavor. Having spent my career in business, NYC teaching fellows was a good way to enter education as a career so I applied.  I am not sure of why I was passed over, as no feed back was given, I had continued my career with Verizon.  

In 2006 we relocated to Florida as my wife accepted a job in Tampa and I purchased a restaurant to start the next phase of my career.  Having to manage 25 employees, most who were young and many growing up disadvantaged, taught me more about managing people than the prior 20 years that I spent in Verizon or in Bars in NYC.  I had engaged the community that we were located in and was a natural to mentor and encourage the young adults looking for a way to help themselves. Using methods my wife had taught me, including modeling, gearing the information based on prior knowledge and experiences as well as setting high standards and positive encouragement allowed me to bring a unexpected high level of service into my establishment. My staff was culturally diverse, as was the clientele, young and exceptionally well prepared to handle what was expected from them as young adults in society.  Education was always put first, their hours were dependent on maintaining good grades in school.  I am proud that I was able to encourage and prepare a great percentage of my former staff for college and life beyond.

I read him some of the coach comments and recommendation. The Principal said that he was also a teaching fellow and had a lot of respect for the program and the decision.

She informed me that she was waiting for her final stipend check (which she received on 8/5) in order to pay off the debt for the previous CUNY school she attended. She mentioned that she had been in contact with Linda from Brooklyn College and informed her that she was waiting for her stipend. I instructed her to follow up with Brooklyn College to find out the deadline she has in order to enroll in courses. I emailed her today to follow up explaining that she need to receive her deadline from Brooklyn College and inform us when this was cleared up. 
",University,university enrollment concern,"We have a major problem with Esther Smith, one of the Science Immersion folks.

Sometime in the past, she attended another CUNY college (New York City Tech) and left them owing money. They turned the problem over to a collection agency and put a ""Stop"" on her computer records, which has made it impossible to register her for her summer classes and will prevent her being enrolled for fall courses.

We notified her of the problem some weeks ago (I believe I copied you on the e-mail), and she was personally told of the problem several weeks ago.  To date, the Stop is still on her records, and she has never even responded to us about how she is going to deal with the issue.

We will not be able to recommend her for a Transitional B Certificate, and she will not receive any credits for her summer courses; nor will she be able to attend classes in the fall.

Perhaps some outreach from your office can get the ball rolling.

Hi Anna and Meha,

An inquiry came to Vicki surrounding a D75 NYC Teaching Fellow candidate  Rachel Manaster.  She was assigned D75 7-12 and appealed to teach at the elementary school level.   Her appeal was denied.

Can you provide us with a little bit more info on:
 Why was her appeal denied?  (e.g., transcript would not qualify her for elementary level or more about supply/demand)
 How many similar cases were there  i.e., Ten D75 7-12 teachers asked to switch or was she the only one?

This info will help me understand if we should recommend any other action for this candidate.  It sounds like she will likely bow out of the program as a D75 7-12 candidate.

Thanks,
Izaak

Hi Ariel,

We have received notification from your university that you are planning on resigning from your NYCDOE position, effective January 5, 2017, and, therefore, from the Fellows program. 

Please keep in mind that if you have resigned from your position, you are no longer eligible to remain in the Fellows program or reapply to the program or to any other NYCDOE alternative certification program. 

Please respond to this email with a written confirmation of your resignation, and we will take care of your withdrawal from our end from there. 

We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors!

Dear Ariel,

Thank you for reaching out about this. Please finish the semester with us, as any grades you earned for the semester will appear on your permanent transcript. I assume you have not registered using CUNYfirst for classes in the Spring 2017 semester, but if you have, please make sure to drop these courses in CUNYfirst so as not to incur any charges.

I am notifying our certification officer of your withdrawal, and she will be revoking our recommendation for your Trans B. You understand that when you resign from the DOE you terminate your contract with the fellows and cannot remain a fellow or at CCNY as a fellow.

Please write to the NYCTF office to notify them of your official withdrawal from the program. I am noting your withdrawal date as today (this does not impact this semester in terms of billing).  Please let me know if you have any additional questions for us.

Best,

Amistad Dual Language School 
4862 Broadway NY, NY 10034


I submitted my resignation letter on Monday, effective on January 5, 2016.

What additional steps do I need to do in regards to CCNY? 

",University,Input from TAD,"Hi Lauren,

I'm traveling and investors got spotty wifi. Here is my additional evidence for Ariel Quiones.

Ariel typically taught between 6 and 12 students. He worked with a Title III summer enrichment program.

I am not sure whether Ariel will raise student achievement in the fall, but leaning towards no. Ariel struggled to create appropriately rigorous lessons and well-sequences lessons for the newcomers in his class. In addition, he struggled to use 100% and Strong Voice consistently, although the culture of the room was usually one in which students maintained appropriate behavioral and academic expectations most of the time.

My recommendation for Ariel entering the classroom this fall is not sure, but leaning towards yes. Ariel took his work very seriously this summer, even if that is not reflected in his ratings. In RCS, Ariel asked great questions and made improvements quickly. These did not always translate into his classroom performance. This summer he worked with all newcomers to the country. Our site did what we could to resource the Fellows in the Title III setting, but those Fellows faced a very challenging scenario that they were only partially equipped to handle.

Ariel never exhibited professionalism concerns.

All best,

Ian

",Pre-Service Training,Input from LI,"Hi Lauren,

I only observed Ariel once, but I will provide all of the information I can based on working with him in RCS, planning, and SBS this summer.

-Rob

Q4: On average, how many students did this Fellow have in their class?
I do not know, as I only observed Ariel once, and I believe he was teaching different sections on different days. The class I saw had 12 students in it.
 
Q5: Assuming this Fellow will not receive any additional support in the Fall from the Fellows program or otherwise, will this Fellow be effective in raising student achievement at a high-needs school in their first year?
 Not sure (leaning towards likely to raise achievement)
Provide specific examples to support your selection.
Ariel was a very conscientious planner. He was open to any and all feedback and implemented it successfully. In the RCS session I did with him, he was able to implement feedback on Strong Voice immediately. Additionally, he was able to have strong takeaways from the ELL Institute. 

        Q6: Making no assumptions about how much support the Fellow may receive in the Fall, do you recommend this Fellow into the classroom? Use examples to support your judgment.
Not sure (leaning towards yes)
         
        Provide specific examples to support your selection. Additionally, please reconcile any conflicting responses between question 4 and question 5. For example, if you are not sure that this Fellow will be effective in their first year but you are recommending them into the classroom, please explain why.
Having had conversations with other staff members, I am aware Ariel struggled with classroom management, so I'm not sure he will immediately raise student achievement. From my perspective as an LI, Ariel was fully engaged in SBS sessions and was conscientious about planning and was always rethinking based on how his lessons were received by students. 
         
Q7: Has the Fellow ever exhibited any concerning evidence in terms of the Essential Professional Traits?
I did not have any concerned about Ariel's professionalism. He was consistently positive and focused on student learning.

After consulting Marie Ilagen and checking the issue log / messages, I explained to Ryan that the issue was her fingerprinting. She said she had been fingerprinted outside of the DOE, but the agency said they had a code that would send the prints to the DOE. I explained that she needed to be fingerprinted at the DOE; there may be other avenues for fingerprinting that do not apply to her, and that the instructions were explicit. I also reiterated that there is not enough time for her fingerprinting to be processed at the DOE, and therefore the withdrawal message she received still stands. Ryan wondered if deferral could be an option or if she could apply again next year and I told her I did not have those answers, but she could get them from the front office. Ryan was upset and said that it seemed unfair because the message she received said fingerprinting was ""pending"" and that she didn't know her prints were inadequate until it was too late. I thanked her for that feedback and suggested that she mention it to the front office when she's asking about her next steps. ",Fingerprinting,Withdrawal - Fingerprinting Requirement,"Below is correspondence with Ryan informing her that we will be withdrawing her from the program 

I received an email today at 3:22pm which I was unable to read until I got home at 8pm which states that I must upload proof of fingerprinting by midnight tonight or I am out of the program. I tried calling to resolve this problem but the hours were over for the day at that point. I got my fingerprinting done and uploading a picture of the receipt to my Tracker account, but it was denied. I think I got fingerprinted in the wrong place. I went through the DOE directions on how to get fingerprinted and got it done. Please, any help would be incredibly appreciated. I really don't want to be kicked out of the program but I also don't know what to do here. And I'm pretty sure any action I would take wouldn't take affect before midnight! Please help!

Hi Ryan, 

Thank you for reaching out about your situation. 

As communicated to you in the Onboarding Guide, NYC Teaching Fellows must be fingerprinted by the NYCDOE at 65 Court Street. Unfortunately, it appears that you got fingerprinted by a vendor outside of the NYCDOE, and we are unable to accept your documentation as proof of fingerprinting on your Checklist. 

Furthermore, since you have not been fingerprinted by the NYCDOE at this time, it will not be possible for you to receive clearance in time for Field Experience, starting on July 5. It is required by law that anyone who is working within a NYCDOE public school be fingerprinted and cleared by the DOE before working with students. As a result of not being able to fulfill this requirement, it is our responsibility to withdraw you from the program. 

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out via the Contact Form.


Best,

So I scheduled to take it tomorrow. I unfortunately had my bag stolen last night which had in it my driver's license. This was what I was using as my primary form of ID for the exam. I do not have any of the other options for primary identification. I am ordering a new driver's license now, but I won't be able to get it before tomorrow. I tried to reschedule my exam for after I get my license but before the June 20th deadline to take the exams, but I cannot find any exam times for before then. I am not sure what to do. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!""",Testing,,,,,,

I can confirm that his coach quit. Her father passed away causing her to withdraw. She did however finish out the week. Her last day was July 22nd. Ephraim expressed to us that he could not meet the Friday lesson plan deadline at 5:00pm because he cannot write any lesson plans starting at sundown on Fridays. We expressed to Ephraim that his lesson plans are actually due before he is required to observe the Sabbath. We also gave him the option of submitting his lesson plans earlier.Below you will find an email I received from Ephraim this Monday

Dear Alaina,
Due to several family medical emergencies I am no longer able to continue with the reaching fellows at this time. I would like to thank you for the opportunity and the experience.
I wish you and everyone else in the program well and count myself lucky for having met and worked with such caring and wonderful. My father's situation has worsened and unfortunately I just found out that my brother has been diagnosed with stomach cancer. I simply can no longer give the program one hundred percent of my attention.
I wish you all the best.
Ephraim Shimoni 

Hope this helps,
Alaina
",Pre-Service Training,attendance follow-up call,"Ephraim returned my call regarding his attendance. He opened saying he has requested to withdrawal from the program by emailing his TAD . I asked if he could share more details on his decision. He stated that his father has serious health issues that required a lot of time. He also stated he felt like it wasnt fair that other universities only had coursework once or twice per week, and he had to attend daily. He also stated that he felt like he wasnt given the equal opportunity to succeed as he is a Sabbath observer, and this was not taken into consideration. I asked if he had expressed his concerns to anyone in the program, and he stated that he spoke to his TAD about his concerns, particularly in regard to lesson planning. I asked what the follow-up was after that discussion, and he stated it was not addressed. He said that he felt that he was set-up to fail. I told him that is not the intent of our program, and that we want all Fellows to succeed. I also said that the schedule of the coursework is dependent on the university, and that all Fellows receive a high-quality coursework experience. I shared that he had the opportunity to reach out to our office to discuss any concerns that he was experiencing. He replied that he wished he knew he could call and speak to us earlier. He also stated that he knows he should have followed up on his concerns, but he was so overwhelmed with PST that he didnt. He stated that he felt like he was being set up to fail by his TA because he was a religious person  he said he was put on a PIP mainly because of his lesson planning because no accommodations were made for his religious observance and that took the wind out of [his] sails. I reiterated that it is not our intent to make anyone feel that they are being set up to fail, and that we want all Fellows to succeed. I stated that the purpose of PIP is to provide supports so that Fellows will be successful in the Fall, and that his TAD and coach were available for any questions regarding the PIP. He said he understood.

I ended the call confirming that his request was to withdraw from the program  he stated that he didnt really want to withdraw now but that it was too late at this time as he has been absent too many times. I stated that it looks like he has been absent five times. He then said that he understands the attendance policy and that he has missed too many days to continue. I wished him the best of luck and ended the call. 
",Pre-Service Training,attendance follow-up call,I called Ephraim on 7/27 to follow-up on his attendance - the primary number that he listed was not in service. I called the secondary phone number on his account and his mother answered - I asked for Ephraim to give me a call back tomorrow.,Pre-Service Training,,,,,,

22-25 
 
Q5: Assuming this Fellow will not receive any additional support in the Fall from the Fellows program or otherwise, will this Fellow be effective in raising student achievement at a high-needs school in their first year? 
No. Due to Scott's persistent challenges in managing the classroom and his mindset issues about having ""bad"" students, I would not think Scott would be able to connect with and manage his own class. 

         
        Q6: Making no assumptions about how much support the Fellow may receive in the Fall, do you recommend this Fellow into the classroom? Use examples to support your judgment.

No. Even when giving him feedback and concrete things to do in his classroom Scott would say things like ""well that student has an IEP"". He shared with me that the AP of the school told him that this(referring to his class of normally behaved middle schoolers) would be the ""worst"" it would get, so he (Scott) was optimistic that the school year wouldnt be as hard. I shared with Scott that this group of students was what he should expect for the Fall, except this time they would be his the entire year not just a few short weeks. In the last week I passed by his classroom and stopped because the noise level was indicating that students were not working. He had his back to the class(he was working with a small group), a student was videotaping other students, kids were wondering around, etc. When I got the students back on track and coached Scott to not have his back to the room, some of the students hadnt even been given the handouts they needed in order to complete the work.  

         
Q7: Has the Fellow ever exhibited any concerning evidence in terms of the Essential Professional Traits?
Yes. In addition to making inappropriate remarks (ie, only behaving 'because of his father's hand"" or saying he had the ""bad"" group), Scott did not implement feedback from his coach about scripting his lesson plans.

Sandy 
Sorry to hear about the drama on this new hire.  It seems like the teacher genuinely had doubts after accepting the position and tried (through a few avenues) to be released and when that wasnt possible resigned as an alternative.  Her resignation says she is resigning from the DOE, which would mean she is not continuing as a prospective teacher.  We are confirming if that is the case  which would also mean she cannot continue in the Fellows program.  If it is not her intent to quit the Fellows program and not work as a teacher, then we are in agreement that she needs to honor her commitment to MS 80 and cannot be hired at another school.  We will be sure to correct any miscommunication/misunderstanding on this matter and I apologize if our team gave out misinformation.  I dont know that it will be the happiest marriage (and actually I see her preferred location is to another Renewal School) but I assume you think best for her to go to MS80. Let me know if you want me to reach out to the principal directly or want us to handle this in a different way.
Thanks, 
Vicki

Do you know this is going on?  What can the principal do?  If she resigned, can this teacher then be hired by another school? What should we do?

Subject: Re: Resignation 10X080
Good morning Denise,

Thank you for your prompt response. Based on this information and the sequence of events that have transpired with regards to Teaching Fellows candidate Denise Alvarez, I have some serious concerns/questions in order to best be prepared for the staffing challenges ahead. 

We currently have 8 vacancies, but weve hired many Teaching Fellows throughout this OOT hiring season. According to the advisement that Denise Alvarez has received from Department of Education officials and possibly the Teaching Fellows, I believe we may be facing a state of emergency with regards to the staffing of our school. 

Basically, this means that all other teaching fellows currently on-boarding with 10X080 have the same option to go elsewhere from now to September 6. 

Please help me determine the extent of our schools vulnerability by providing answers to the following HR questions in order for me to plan for this emergency:

1. Are Teaching Fellows allowed to circumvent the release process by resigning from school A in order to be staffed at school B?

2. Since everyone knows that Denise Alvarez is intending to circumvent the release process in order to get hired at X363, how does or doesnt the new Chancellors Reg C-205 apply here? See P-Weekly excerpt below.

From P weekly
Guidance on 30-Day Advanced Notice Requirement for Pedagogue Resignations
All schools
In accordance with Chancellors Regulation C-205, all pedagogues who want to resign from the NYCDOE must submit letters of resignation at least 30-calendar days in advance of their date of resignation; your teachers were reminded of this requirement in the May 10 edition of I Teach NYC. Please note that this requirement only applies to pedagogues who plan to end their service with the NYCDOE; as noted in the March 22 edition of Principals Weekly, teachers who would like to change schools within the NYCDOE should use the Open Market Transfer system by August 8 to find and apply for open positions.

3. Does it work both ways, where Principals could also remove candidates after being intended on Galaxy, while in the midst of the on-boarding process? For example, if I find a stronger candidate for any position where a Teaching Fellow is currently on-boarding.

4. Is it possible that other Staff members at 10X080 could be removed from Galaxys table of organization without notifying the Principal? If so, should I be checking everyday to make sure that every staff member is still on the TO or is there another way for me to see changes made to Galaxy by external DOE staff? 
Just to provide some clarity as the sequence of events that I'm referring to and the rationale to support my concerns/questions, please see the timeline below.  
Timeline of events in regards to Denise Alvarez:

July 14- Denise Alvarez emails Mr. Polanco expressing interest in a mathematics position at MS80.
July 20- 
 Ms. Alvarez interviews with MS80 Committee
 Ms. Alvarez is offered a Math Position

August 18 - Principal Angelo Ledda(X363- Another District 10 Renewal School) emails Mr. Polanco asking if I was going to release Ms. Alvarez to go work at his school. 
August 25- Lauren Kraus-Senior Teacher Staffing Support Manager emails Ms. Polanco the following email. Just to be clear, Mr. Polanco has never communicated directly with Ms. Alvarez. 

 
August 25- Mr. Polanco replies to Victoria that he will not be able to release Ms. Alvarez.
August 25- Mr. Polanco replies to Principal Ledda to inform him that he would not be able to release Ms. Alvarez.

Good morning Victoria and Denise,
 
Do any of you know who may have advised Ms. Alvarez to take this course of action? Also, do any of you know who or how she was removed from 10X080's Galaxy without my knowledge or even notification that this action has been taken? Any clarification and guidance would be helpful. Thank you.

",Job Search,rescinding job offer,"Denise wrote into the Contact Form on 8/4:

I was hired at MS. 80 in the Bronx and I signed the hiring commitment form . I have recently discovered that the principal of MS. 80 is an amateur reggaeton artist who demeans women in his music videos. I was also recently made aware of complaints and lawsuits against the principal of MS. 80 for his mistreatment of female members of his teaching staff. In light of these findings, I am no longer comfortable teaching at MS. 80 and would like the opportunity to consider teaching positions at other schools. Can I break the commitment and start looking for teaching positions at other schools?

I told her that we generally are unable to grant deferrals, but we would consider her request, and if she felt that she could not complete the requirements, she had the option of withdrawing and re-applying in the future. The deferral was not granted.

I spoke with Heather from program operations and wrote previously about having to stay at my current job due to a financial situation my family has encountered. I was unable to work out a solution and will not be able to continue with the teaching fellows this year. I was informed that I will be able to apply again in the future and I will do so as soon as possible. In regards to my certifications, If I receive a passing grade on all the required certification exams, can I present those scores when I reapply to the program, or would I have to retake the exams again during the next application process? I would like to extend a tremendous thank you for the wonderful opportunity presented to me this year and a thank you for the help and assistance that was provided to me. I am eagerly anticipating re-applying to the teaching fellows in the future. I can't see myself in any other career besides teaching.

I hope this email finds you well. My colleague passed along your request to defer your participation in the NYC Teaching Fellows program.

Since we typically do not offer deferrals, I'm writing to ask for more information regarding your situation so that we can discuss available options at this time. 

Please reach out via our Contact Form to provide more information, or give us a call during our phone hours (11:30 - 3:30pm).

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
