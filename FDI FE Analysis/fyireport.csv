""Good morning Kelly,

I got bad news. I just received a letter from my landlord requesting I pay rent owed (i owe a couple of months) within three days. I am still waiting to get my DOE stipend for September, which would help, but it looks like I will need to take action on Monday, to avoid eviction procedures. 
I may be eligible to get emergency funds to get out of this situation, but will have to go to my local office of social services with proper documentation in person on Monday morning. I won't be able to make to school on Monday. I don't know how to go about this, whether I need to let NYCTF know or what. They're strict about absentism, but this is an emergency situation I need to take care of immediately. 
Please let me know what you think I should do.
Thanks!""

She decided to come in the next day and leave at noon. On Tuesday, she informed me that she would have to leave early again for the same reason. She left the school one hour before dismissal.","My response:

Hi, Monica,

I'm sorry to hear your news! It sounds very stressful for you and your daughter.

You're right that NYCTF is very strict about absenteeism--coaches are required to report attendance--but they are also human. I'm sure they will understand it's an emergency situation. From my perspective, honesty and transparency are best, especially in situations such as these.

Since you're going to the social services office first thing in the morning, if you can make it to school afterward so you have a chance to practice your reading lesson, that would be great (I wrote the lesson plan this morning and will send you a copy soon). Of course, I understand that such appointments can be unpredictable.

I do wish you the best luck. Hopefully money will come and you can be free of this stress.

Take care!

Kelly

It was written in response to Monica's inquiry. I'm including Monica's original inquiry and my response (suggestions). 

Hi,
I am working on the LP for the newcomer period tomorrow. 
Just want to double check with you that i will teach the verb ""to have,"" and the numbers. I was also thinking of teaching a few vocabulary words (book, pencil, marker). Will that be too much?
I'll send you the lesson plan as soon as i have it. 
M.

I responded with the following:

Hi, Monica,

Thanks for your message. I'm copying Eddie and Laura so we are all on the same page with the newcomer instruction. This will facilitate planning between you and Eddie and will help Laura and I know how we can deliberately support that instruction in the general ed classroom.

As we've discussed, please teach chunks of language. Rather than teach ""to have"" (which rarely appears in written or spoken English) teach ""I have""  ""He has"" ""They have"" etc. Please also teach the question frame: Do you have a pencil? (Yes, I have a pencil). I recommend beginning with the do/does question construction because it precedes 'what' questions in the acquisition sequence and is a much more frequently heard question in transactional classroom contexts. 

I would also add: ""pick up, notebook, coat, and lunch. As we think about language to teach, think about the types of exchanges students have throughout the day. Example, ""Please take out your notebooks. Do you have your notebook?"" and ""We have recess today. Please bring your coats. Do you have your coat?""

Note: Realia (objects) are very powerful at this stage. So, have all of these objects on hand during your lesson so all students can actually hold the object up as they say, ""Yes, I have a notebook."" Teach each object with the appropriate article ""a notebook.""

In my opinion, it will be higher impact to focus on this language in the foreground of your lesson. You can incorporate numbers by counting down and holding up signs with numbers written in word form at different points in the lesson. For example, ""Pick up your notebook"" then count aloud while holding up signs ""ten, nine, eight"" etcetera.

Remember, slow, steady and systematic instruction is highest impact for newcomers. You should expect to do lots of repetition. Eddie, you should anticipate reviewing and building on tomorrow's lesson with your Friday lesson. 

One last point: be sure to touch on all four modalities: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. 

Please find the social studies lesson attached to this message. I will create the graphic organizer for this as well as the handout for the writing active engagement activity, as promised. However, please note that moving forward you will be responsible for creating any presentations or materials that accompany your lessons starting next week. As always, let me know if you have any questions.

Best wishes!

She also told me there have been instances of Monica speaking ill of students to other teachers in the building.  The principal  is very apprehensive about the situation moving forward and doesn’t want Monica in her building anymore - she was pretty adamant about this.

The principal is a former Fellow and has worked for us in the past, so she understands that there are systems and processes that need to occur before a Fellow is removed from a setting, but she still wanted to bring it to my attention.

Thank you for letting me discuss the Field Experience assignment. I hoped I could work through the challenges and felt encouraged by my lead instructor to persevere and succeed by putting the students first. However after the incident before my field observation on September 29th, I am concerned that even though I am doing everything I can to follow Fellows' practices and keep the coaching relationship positive, my success in the program is in the hands of a coach who does not believe in the NYCTF program and does not give me the specific actionable feedback I need to develop. My coach does not have a positive communication style, and is very sensitive to any perceived criticism or disloyalty. I feel I am walking on eggshells around her. There have been numerous incidents, which I have included below, including retaliation when asked by the Fellows to include me in certain meetings. 

On my first day at the school, Rose Abreu was surprised to see me and appeared highly stressed. She then went on to say that my first week in her classroom was ‘the worst week of her professional life’. I am considerate and respectful of her time and other priorities but I feel unwelcome in her classroom and do not sense that she enjoys the coaching relationship.

My coach is unreceptive to my suggestions or ideas, makes it clear that my role as a Fellow is to accept and obey without question. For example, at first, I felt that I was spending a lot of time photocopying alone or sitting on my own in an empty classroom. I was instructed not to read TLAC or do any college coursework during these empty periods as Mrs Abreu said that the Principal would disapprove if he was to look in and see me. Later, when I asked if I could introduce a ’Do Now’ into the lesson, I was told to just follow her lesson plan exactly. (I have since started doing Do Nows, and they have been accepted into the lesson and are now used more frequently.)

Mrs Abreu is sensitive to any perceived disloyalty. On three separate occasions, I've been reprimanded for having conversations about my classroom experience. None of these conversations were critical of her but there were  consequences for me, including having prep time for the classroom observation taken away from me without notice. Here are the details.

On the first occasion on 9/21 she said she had heard from 'someone via one of the Fellows at the school' that I wanted more teaching time. I was questioned in an accusatory way about why I had discussed my classroom experience with someone else. I felt extremely intimidated even though what I said was respectful and appropriate. I had simply said to my peers about a week earlier that I was not getting as much time with students as I had hoped. I had even asked her a week before that when I might begin teaching small groups and although she seemed irritated that I had brought it up, I was assigned teaching time. She seemed angry that I had spoken to someone else and not at all concerned about allaying my concerns about a gradual release of classroom time. 

After that interaction, I  sent a friendly message to my fellow Fellows at MS319 reminding them that we are building our professional relationships and not to say anything that might be misunderstood or taken out of context. Rose found out about that message and reprimanded me again. She said that was a private conversation and I should not have disclosed it to anyone. 
There was a third incident like this a week later. I don’t know if Lizette will remember this, but when she visited my classroom on 9/28, she observed that I should be attending meetings with the intervention specialists and she would mention it to my coach. I asked Lizette to be very diplomatic about giving that feedback. 

The next day, 45 minutes before the observation, Mrs Abreu told me to stop preparing and said I had to follow her to cover a lesson because 'someone, she didn't know who' had told the Fellows that I should be in all her meetings. After a few minutes, when I realized she would not compromise, I said we should run it past Ms Lloyd to get clarification as this was an important day for me. She said 'this is nothing to do with Ms Lloyd, this is coming directly from the Fellows'. Mrs Abreu came into Ms Lloyd's room and claimed that she had told me that she would allow me to continue preparing for my assessment and that I had walked out of the classroom.  Both of these statements are false. I asked three times if I could finish preparing and received an unequivocal ‘no’ every time. It is my belief that by denying me the little time she had allowed me to prepare, she intended to derail my lesson and upset me before my assessment. That day after school, I stopped in at the Fellows office and told Dana everything. I am concerned that the support and feedback I need is being withheld by my coach. 

There is a disconnect between the support she says she is giving me, and the practical support I am actually receiving. The most measurable disconnect is in the time she says she gives me to prepare.

On 9/29, Mrs Abreu told Ms Lloyd that I had two full periods on Wednesday, the day before the assessment to practice and prepare my lesson - from 8-9:34. What actually happened was that I was instructed to make several hundred lesson plan copies - collated, stapled, etc - for a meeting she was attending later. I started making those copies at 7:50 and finished at 9:15. I had less than 20 minutes to prepare .On another occasion, Mrs Abreu made repeated references to a 3-minute video that was part of the lesson that she says I refused to watch. She did tell me about the video on the Friday before the assessment, but on that day, I was assisting her with putting up classroom bulletin boards prior to school inspection, and in any case, they made no sense without the lesson plan, which I did not receive until after school ended on the following Tuesday (two days before my observation). 

 There are too many instances like this to mention, when she claims that she offered me resources that I have refused to use. These are just not true. I have worked hard to meet all of her demands, and am receptive in accepting and integrating her feedback.

I know that she takes a lot of notes but she rarely shares her specific observations with me. On one occasion, she asked me how I felt a class had gone. I said that I had not been able to bring the class together quickly enough and asked what she suggested I do next time. She said, “I’m not going to tell you, I want you to figure it out yourself.” I thought I had been unclear, and said, “In the Skillbuilding Sessions, we give a glow and a grow” and she said, “Just think, what have you seen me do, or what have you seen one of the other Fellows do?” I was genuinely mystified and gave a very general response which she seemed satisfied with but which did not give me any specifics to draw on for the next time I had that problem.  I rarely receive positive feedback. 

I feel excluded from lesson planning.  There is a tendency to hold back information about the lessons, and it is sometimes difficult for me to find out what will be happening so that I can plan and prepare. Mrs Abreu has resisted all of my efforts to plan out the week in advance. 

Additionally, Mrs Abreu has made it clear that she does not believe in the fellows program (smiled and shook her head when I asked if she had been a fellow). She also said on two occasions that she does not believe there are enough jobs in the city for us saying who's going to hire a new teacher in the middle of the year? 

Finally, I would like to say that I am prepared to do whatever it takes to make this placement work. I have tried to make full use of my time at the school, and have found that other members of staff have been very welcoming to me in their classrooms. This is a wonderful school in which to do Field Experience. At the end of last week, Ms Lloyd asked Mrs Abreu to release me for two periods on Wednesday to observe and ultimately co-teach an ESL class at the school. I am putting my heart and soul into this opportunity and enjoy the time I spend teaching students at this school.

Hi all,
 
Just got off the phone with Lizette about the Fellow I had e-mailed about yesterday. She shared some additional context about the situation. Basically Lizette had spoken to the Lead Coach at the school and was informed about the relationship between Maria and her CC being a little rocky. She ended up spending over an hour with them during the first visit which included observing a coaching conversation and talking separately and together with both the Fellow and CC. She said overall the coaching conversation was pretty strong, with the one weakness being modeling and that she suggested including that piece in future conversations because it seemed like the Fellow really needed the modeling piece. 
 
She went back a couple weeks later and the CC said things were getting better, slowly, but definitely better. The Lead Coach also said the Maria, the Fellow, sometimes was resistant to feedback and Lizette gave a few scenarios of this. Overall, Lizette thinks that there is some truth in what the Fellow is seeing, what the CC is seeing, and what the LC has seen. So, she and I are going to visit the Fellow and Coach together this Thursday. We are not going to let them know ahead of time we are coming so that we can see a more natural environment of whatever is happening during the 8:30 – 9:00/9:15 time on Thursday. 
 
Let me know if you would like any other information but this was pretty much the gist of it – though I took some additional notes on my phone (as my computer was deciding to update as soon as the call started) I would be happy to share! 
 
I’ll definitely update everyone post Thursday too!

 After school on Tuesday 10/19, I asked Mrs A if we could go class by class through the rest of the week and align my teaching schedule to the pacing guide. I want to be more proactive about asking for teaching time because I haven't been assigned any teaching time since October 12th. 
It took half an hour for me to just get the content area for each lesson.  When I had the rest of the week written down, it was apparent that I wouldn't be teaching at all this week outside the observation. I asked if we could review the pacing guide on the NYCTA and align my teaching time accordingly and she brushed my concerns aside. I persevered and every answer was vague and non committal. 
I then asked about preparing for my observation and on the positive side she said she would give me the lesson plan for the observation on Wednesday and I would have two double periods on Thursday and Friday to prepare. 
Then when I came in the following day (yesterday Wednesday 10/19), Mrs A told me during the first period that I would be lead teaching the entire third and fourth periods and gave me the materials. I was quite surprised  because it was an aside as she was teaching and I had been in her classroom until 4pm the day before asking about this exactly and she hadn't mentioned it. When the students had left the classroom I said I didn't feel comfortable teaching the whole double period on such short notice. I had taught the majority of the lesson two weeks earlier so the lesson wasn't entirely new but I didn't feel there was adequate time to review and prepare the whole lesson. She didn't suggest a co-teach or that I teach say half, she just said 'fine I'll teach it but I'm going to make a note of this because I'm giving you teaching time but you don't seem to want it.' During the lesson, I made a couple of group corrections as I was circulating and she wouldn't acknowledge or reinforce anything I said. She just acted as though I was not there. 

Two other things that came up:
She said she was unhappy with my timekeeping. I asked what time she would like me to be there and she answered that she has seen one of the other Fellows arriving at 7 and she is on the same program as me. 
She said that I was avoiding teaching 602 and 702 (not a grain of truth in this) and was not sure I wanted to take the opportunities she was offering me and that she wanted to contact the fellows to postpone my second evaluation.

The NYC Teaching Fellows program is dedicated to providing NYC public school students with exemplary teachers by supporting our Fellows during a rigorous pre-service training experience. The goal of this Professionalism Concern Letter is to provide you with individualized support in order to make significant growth during pre-service training. We expect you to take the action steps outlined below in order to meet our ongoing high expectations.","As an educator for 22 years that has held many leadership roles, I have developed effective communication skills. These skills allow me to build relationships of respect and rapport with students and their families, my colleagues, and the school administration as well as supporting agencies. 

I am appalled to have my name attached to such false and inaccurate accounts of what has transpired since Maria Clegg joined us at MS319. I will not have her discredit my profession and professionalism. 

On many occasions she has been able to observe students and adults alike commend me for being a great teacher either because of my teaching strategies or modeling of best practices. My classroom is open to all for resources whether they are for school use or personal lunch storage. As a member of this school community, I ensure that I support the administration with their goals. Because of my sterling qualities, I have been hired as a Peer Collaborative Coach. This role entails lots of responsibilities as Maria has observed and stated, 'you wear many hats' that go beyond teaching. Also, my teaching schedule is different from other content teachers because I teach the science lab component to most of the 6th and 7th grade classes. Furthermore, I have been assigned to work with the schools Intervention Specialist and to meet periodically with the school Principal.


Let me clarify the false statements that have been placed on this teacher track:

* First day of school I was surprised to see her and appeared highly stressed. 
 I had not met Maria prior to her appearance at my door. 7:00 am someone knocks on the classroom door, I inquire who she is. We were told that all fellows would meet in the main office and then introduced to us. Therefore, how could I be stressed not knowing who she was, yet I knew I was expecting a fellow. 

* stated, ' my first week in her classroom was the worst of her professional life'. I never made that statement about her. I introduced her to staff and students alike, and engaged her in meetings. When the students arrived for the 1st week of school, I introduced her as a co teacher. I only had two classes. Unacceptable that she would make this accusation towards her.

* As Maria has observed, my schedule has has openings that are reserved for TIF, pull out  and Professional Periods. I had asked Maria to make photocopies of materials needed for our upcoming classes. My classroom is not empty if I have scheduled classes throughout the day. I did mention that it was not the NYCTF expectation that they do coursework during the day. It was a time to be used for class routines and preparations. I was reiterating what was shared with me. YES the principal would disapprove because the expectation is that she is preparing to be a teacher and to be teaching our students even if not at the beginning of the year. None of the other fellows would be doing their school work during these 'open periods'. Furthermore, fellows were to follow our plans. Our do nows are specific engaging students with immediate discussion. She wanted to post a list of things to do which could have been verbally shared with the students. My modeling of the do now was to prepare her for her lesson planning.

* Mrs. Abreu is sensitive to any perceived disloyalty. 
  The fact that Maria has been disloyal having conversations about me with a  negative connotation is of a concern. She was provided the allotted time and even extra time as observed during a classroom visit by Lizette. I   actually asked her if it was ok that I allow her to teach before the NYCTF scheduled time. Lizette responded yes.
Maria has a different understanding of what a PST and CC confidential conversation alerting her about 'talking about me and us' to others and how it can be perceived. Especially about events that have been observed that speak contrary to what she is saying.

* Meeting's with the Intervention Specialist. 
  How is this a reprimand. My schedule is changed constantly to meet the needs of all. At times the IS are not available and I have to go look for them. She uses this time to plan which is more than time than any other fellow is allotted. 

* stop planning to go cover class
 Because she was informed that she is to go to class coverages, I informed her that I had a coverage which we were expected to go to. I didn't have previous notice. However, I did tell her she could stay planning, but to note that I did ask her to come with me. Instead of using the time to plan, she walked out to find the TL in the copy room. We then walked to the TL's room where Maria admitted that I was giving her the two periods to plan. TL restated that a teacher only gets a 1 prep and that she was getting 2.  Maria was not respectful of my role as her CC when she walked out on my advisement to go tell the TL which only led to restating what I had already said. 

* Video Lesson Plan
Photo copies were for sub lesson plans. The copies were made in a timely manner however, because the copier ran out of staples, she sat a began to staple them. I had no idea the copy machine was out of staples. I never asked her to staple them. We discussed that she should have told me about the staples and that could have been done at a later time. They were not needed for a meeting.

 In preparation for her upcoming lesson, I provided her with the student activity and video on the computer. She left the paper just as I had given it to her. When Lizette came the following week, I made reference to the same task to which I stated  she did not view or do. A lesson plan was not needed as it was a student activity that she was simulating to understand what students were being asked to do. But again Maria felt it didn't make sense so she didn't view the 3 minute video at all. 

* Takes a lot of notes
 After every class observation, we have debriefs where I have even indicated the colored boxes as the next steps. We follow the debrief protocol and lock in the date for the next practice. 

*""I'm not going to tell you, I want you to figure it out""
  As a point of reflection, Maria has distorted this piece of the debrief. She was able to reflect and provide the next steps as she stated "" I should have...""
  The TL also used a similar statement when we debriefed with her during the modeling part where she struggled to visually capture what we wanting her to address.

* Excluded from lesson planning
 Maria was provided with my teaching schedule from the beginning of the school year and 2 more times since then as it has changed both in soft and hard copy. However, because Maria has not embraced the classes nor has she captured the flow of classes (what they did, what they are going to do next...) as the lesson plans are provided and placed on an easel by the front door ( accessible to her and others), every day she comes in to ask what the lesson will be. When I share with her, yet again, she responds in an 'oh yes, right'. This is on a daily basis. She states that she has difficulties remembering because of all her class work and getting home so late.

* Mrs. Abreu does not believe in the Fellows Program
 Maria does not know what my beliefs are because we have never discussed them. I have worked with teaching fellows during summer programs and the school year in the past. She has read the cards of accolade that adorn my wall where they candidly thank me for their support. Furthermore, I have been able to make correct observations to their leadership when Fellows have been resistant or not in compliance with the expectations. I have even been able to give great recommendations where a fellow was hired on my recommendation and became a member of our school community. 
Maria was questioning the possibilities of being employed at MS319 in the Spring. I told her I did not know of a vacancy, actually we discussed how one of our teachers was just let go and not because of budgetary constraints, therefore I was not sure if their would be a budget for another teacher. That is not my area of information. However, Maria went on to mention maternity leave because one of our teachers is expecting. Again, not my area to provide that information. We did discuss being placed in the city with regards to ESL. I did state that perhaps NYCTF had openings already identified with principals, vacancies do arise.  She stated no. Again, not my area of information. Currently, I am in year 2 supporting student teachers from Barnard College by co teaching, co planning and preparing family events. 

* ESL Class
Prior to this class, I went to my ESL colleagues and asked if they could allow Maria to observe and support with their class because her field study was ESL. I immediately provided Maria with a hard copy of a schedule with all the classrooms, times and teacher's names. She went once. TL questioned why she did not continue. I shared that she wanted to plan during that time. We have re instructed her to continue with her class observations and supports.

Maria is correct in that there are too many instances like the above to mention and address on a daily basis with her. She has been observed by 7 different people which all have similar concerns about her being present in the field experience and her not capturing the feedback that is being provided whether visually or verbal. She makes too many mentions about the amount of coursework that she has and how late she gets home late.  She is asked to teach a class (previously taught 3 times) with all the materials provided and she states that she needs time ( a day ) to run a script. 

It is I that is walking on egg shells not being able to ask for assistance with copies for the lesson, distribution of materials, for her to go visit other classrooms, asking her to implement her provided feedback, or anything else that is required for the school day. She has taken this venue to discredit me and my profession after I have opened my classroom to support her. Maria has been well welcomed as the other fellows have been . We have shared welcoming moments outside of school as well as inside. Maria chose not to participate in a recent staff baby shower even after i sent numerous text messages to her from across they hall. Just recently she stated that my height intimidated her because I had such a command with my students. My height does not provide my qualifications rather than my experience, knowledge, and continuance to study. 

I hope this clarifies any negative perceptions associated with my name and professionalism. Perhaps a new environment would be best suited for Maria if she feels that the 7 separate observers are not best suiting her needs.

Collegially yours, 
Rose Abreu

On this day, I had to reach out to the TL because Maria is ""not remembering"" the feedbacks being provided to her by Lizette and myself.

 ","On Lizette's last visit, Maria and I were coached on using google docs to share lesson plans and documents such as a calendar to provide a week-at-a-glance for her.  That feedback escaped her when I did not receive the lesson plans on google docs nor was the anticipated calendar, that Maria was to create for us. When I asked why she had not used google docs as we agreed upon on Friday afternoon, after I gave her my gmail, she didn't think that was what we had agreed on. I asked her if she recalled me giving her the gmail, she responded yes. I inquired as to why I would have given her that gmail if it wasn't the expected means of communication, she responded she didn't recall we had made a definitive decision on that even after Lizette physically modeled wiggling her fingers in front of us, asking us if we had google docs at the school, and me sharing my gmail with Maria. This is a repeated pattern of behavior for Maria. 

When she insisted on using a document that she had created on word, I agreed to it but she stated that any additions I was to make on it  would distort the document. I added that is why Lizette suggested the shared document on google docs. She was steadfast on saying that she would not create another document because it was too much work for her. I suggested to create it for us and share it on google docs, she still refused. 

Maria has overlooked the fact that in order for me to give her feedback on her lessons it caused more work for me because I had to download it from word, highlight glows and grows, write them separately, and then resend. Additionally, I had to create the week-at-a glance where I had to add every expected teaching , planning(prep) period, class visit, and other class activities. This caused me more work than it would have for her to use google docs.

She was hoping to speak to someone about these concerns as she feels she is reaching a breaking point and being retaliated against from her Coach. I asked her to share a little more about what was happening and recorded notes below. Maria presented a commitment to the program and serving her students and maintained a professional demeanor during the entire call. 

• One of Maria’s primary concerns was about getting adequate time to lead teach as her Coach was not providing her with the opportunities to do so that they has discussed. From Maria’s perspective, it seems the Coach is “refusing to provide her with lead teaching time” at this point. 
• Maria expressed feeling some retaliation from her coach after the visit from our program last week. It sounds like the Coach may feel like Maria is trying to undermine her, whereas Maria has felt like she is being bullied. She shared that in receiving feedback from her Coach and asking questions her coach responded that she was “sick of your feedback and pushback. I don’t want to discuss this.”
• This afternoon Maria shared that her Coach “very aggressively shared her frustrations with her” for 45min and when Maria asked if she could take a minute before class started again to collect herself, her Coach said she would tell the Fellows program that she had left the classroom. Maria said that she has tried to document these cases as they happen and has notes for reference.
• Maria also spoke about an instance in which her coach made her teach the exact same lesson again to the same group of students for reasons that weren’t made clear to her. She shared that students were frustrated to listen to the same material and it didn’t seem related to incorporating any additional feedback. 
• Maria ended by sharing that she was willing to do whatever it took to make things work but that she was reaching out in hopes of getting additional support to help manage this relationship as it seemed to only be getting worse. 

It sounds like Maria may have reached out to Jen, her LI, but my understanding was she hadn’t heard anything back from her yet. ","In an informal debrief, Maria shared that her lesson was awful and agreed that it was a lesson to do over. I then asked if she was able to reflect on this lesson and understand the 'why' it had to be retaught, then why would she make an accusation 'Maria also spoke about an instance in which her coach made her teach the exact same lesson again to the same group of students for reasons that weren’t made clear to her. She shared that students were frustrated to listen to the same material and it didn’t seem related to incorporating any additional feedback' when the mentioned lesson took her 3 teaching periods. This is an identififed area of growth for Maria from the FEM feedback.  Today's lesson was no different. She was unable to deliver her lesson because of the extensive time she takes for delivery, student redirection, and overall pacing of the activities. 

She also went on to say that she wasn't going to reward the students with the activity because of their misbehavior. The lesson was part of the unit of study. Therefore, it was not something they were earning as a prize, but a learning activity necessary for their academic development. The fact that the delivery was unorganized and not paced properly led to the students being distracted with much idle time. I intervened and informed her that she should have the students read the experiment before listing materials on a worksheet without knowing how they were going to be used. She nodded and continued with the worksheet. She responded it was ok, that she was just going to have them list the materials. I once again reminded her of the structure of reading about the investigation first, then follow the steps to the scientific method on the worksheet. As I circulated among the students, many did not have the document to read from. Many students were inquiring about the paper.  This is yet another example of Maria's unwillingness to take feedback from my coaching practice even in the moment that it will make a difference in student participation and learning. 

Maria was made aware of my displeasure of her accusations 'Maria has felt like she is being bullied.' 

I went on to address her accusation of “sick of your feedback and pushback. I don’t want to discuss this.” To this she denied having said that. I informed her to contact Heather who took the intake and inform her of her misquote. There seems to be many insinuations of ' It sounds like the Coach' Statements should be written as stated with no assumptions or insinuations of circumstances and feelings.

The issue of retaliation is also daunting.  Last week's visit provided clarity on many issues which I posed as questions so that it would not seem as if I was suggesting that Maria was going against the norms of NYCTF. For example, release time. She wanted release time to come in later because of coursework. She also mentioned having been called for a job interview. She stated it was a special ed position and she could not consider it. Chris clarified that there were no interviews. Maria later denied having said that she went on the interview and that she has many professional contacts and that was one. She then shared that there were going to be group work with her coursework and wanted to know if she could use the time then, even though it was not happening as of yet.

Furthermore, 'Maria’s primary concerns was about getting adequate time to lead teach as her Coach was not providing her with the opportunities to do so that they has discussed' Maria has been offered multiple opportunities  however she reneges from her own opportunities by stating that she needs a day to go over a script ( on a lesson she had previously taught twice) or more time to get comfortable with the content even after my modeling lessons with two different classes. With that said, I have been diligently following the NYCTF pacing, yet with Lizette's approval, I gave her teaching time as part of our collaboration and her acceptance. 
Furthermore, she has been instructed to develop her strong start and threshold before moving into teaching a full class. She still has not proven to be very successful with this component.

Is there anyone I can talk to? She is threatening again to give bad feedback to the fellows about me because I am always giving her 'pushback'. When I could see how angry she was becoming I kind of stopped talking thinking she would calm down but she kept haranguing me for another twenty minutes and then started demanding a list of ways she is not supporting me and started making bullet points. I asked her very respectfully if we could pause this conversation as i was not feeling comfortable with the high level of emotion. She pushed me for about another five minutes saying I'm late for a meeting but we are going to finish this, you just want to get out of talking about this.' This has been the worst interaction so far. She seemed to be trying to push me to the point of anger or tears even after I asked her several times if we could take a pause. 
I don't know what to do. ","*She is threatening again to give bad feedback to the fellows about me because I am always giving her 'pushback'. 
Maria is always giving pushback and has a concern with any request for classroom support, i.e. I recently informed her that grades needed to be placed on the student grading system. She immediately asked how long that would take because she had planning to do (Her planning time was not scheduled for this day). To give a time frame of 'how long' would depend on her speed in inputing the grades. She insisted on me giving her a time frame. I responded that i did not know, and referenced the last time she created the classes on the same system to guide her self with that time frame. She stated that was different.

* haranguing me for another twenty minutes 
I don't lecture. I don't have the luxury of 20 minutes to lecture her or anyone else especially if I was on my way to a meeting. We were in close proximity to the door, and at no moment did anyone come in to inquire as to my haranguing. And even when a colleague entered, the tone was not loud or hostile. It would have been noticeable even to the AP outside my room. 

*demanding a list of ways she is not supporting me and started making bullet points.
I asked her to tell me what I could further do for her that I seem to may not be doing or have overlooked. She was silent, so I asked again. She was still silent and refused to respond, so I asked yet again. She then gave me her list for 'clarity'. 

* She pushed me for about another five minutes saying I'm late for a meeting but we are going to finish this, you just want to get out of talking about this.' This has been the worst interaction so far. She seemed to be trying to push me to the point of anger or tears even after I asked her several times if we could take a pause. 

I did state that we would finish the conversation but I had to leave. When she asked for a moment , i stated she could have the classroom because I was leaving. She stated that she only needed a few minutes and would be there when I got back. So she understood that we would discuss the matter further for clarity. 

It is I that is at a lost on what to do.

This morning, Lizette, Chris, and I (Carly) spent several hours at MS 319 school trying to understand the situation between Maria and her Coach. Ultimately, there are several issues at play. 
- Based on our conversations and those that Chris and Lizette had previously, Maria seems to have some challenges remembering and processing information that have resulted in both her needing to ask her coach for the same information multiple times,  as well as challenges with remembering and incorporating feedback. Her coach shared several examples of this when we met with her one on one- including directions to share lesson plans in google drive so that Rose could easily share feedback which were shared as email attachments instead, directions to create a shared calendar (a strategy that was meant to support Maria and Rose in working together to ensure Maria understood the teaching expectations) that was shared as a word doc. When the coach asked that Maria share it in a way that was shareable and editable by both parties, she said that Maria pushed back, and Rose ultimately had to be the one to create the system. She also shared examples of having modeled particular instructional strategies she expected Maria to use (such as the use of a tchart to guide students through the lessons each day) and showed us examples of what she had shown Maria as well as the poster Maria had created which did not have the necessary components. Her coach was concerned that this was leading to lost instructional time (as it sounds like Maria struggles to get through full lessons and often has to roll parts of lessons into additional periods when she doesn't finish them all).
- Her coach, Rose, shared with us that she was not logging incidents when they came up- particularly early on (prior to mid October)- as she felt that she was working to build the coaching relationship and was uncomfortable with the idea of logging information. However, that this has been a challenge since the beginning. 
- After today’s visit, Rose (the coach) shared that she no longer feels that she can continue to support Maria in her classroom as she has put a large amount of time and effort into supporting Maria and it has become too much. She has added several additional items into TT2 about incidents in the last several weeks. She also expressed concerns and was very upset about the allegations against her that Maria has made. 
- 
","Before leaving the school, Chris, Lizette and I debriefed with Maria. We told Maria to head home for the rest of the day (she will attend SBS) while we determined a new placement for her. She was very relieved. However, We also had a professionalism conversation with her during which I shared the ways in which critical thinking and application of feedback were core to her success of a teacher. I shared that we had concerns about this based on examples from her interactions with her coach thus far. We asked her to reflect on strategies she needs to put in place for herself to recall information or feedback that she received, emphasizing that her coach’s first responsibility is to her students, and that her coach should not have to share the same information with her multiple times. We also emphasized that teaching is a fast paced profession in which she will be expected to make strong decisions in the moment and will often need to respond to last minute adjustments that she wasn't anticipating and that thus far, we have heard that this is something she has struggled with and/or pushed back on. 

Maria seemed to struggle to understand that she had a role in the challenging relationship between herself and her coach. She shared that she did understand that she was often asking for the same information multiple times and attributed it to the new environment of being in a school. She was going to spend time reflecting this afternoon on the systems she would put in place for herself to prevent this situation from happening moving forward. 


Given the gravity of this situation (we have had to switch her classroom), at this point, I'm recommending that we issue a PCL for this Fellow as a written follow up to the conversation we had this morning.

","I contacted Ms. Aquilar about this request and cc her on the email informing Maria that it would be best if she just took notes during our meetings instead of taping the conversation.  She responded saying it was not a problem and that she understood.  She was also given some alternate suggestions by Ms Aquilar as well which is stated below.

Maria- I'd also like to add that taping conversations is not an acceptable practice amongst educators.  For example, teachers do not tape the conversations they have with their principals, and vice versa, so I think Tyece is correct in not allowing it here as well.  

What would be a more professional way to check if your notes are accurate would be to send a follow up email to Tyece after your meetings listing what you understood your next steps to be.  This will give Tyece a chance to respond in writing and correct any misconceptions or to affirm your understanding.",Tyece Lloyd,tlloyd@schools.nyc.gov,Tyece Lloyd,tlloyd@schools.nyc.gov,,,Najah Gall,Najah.Gall@nyctfops.org,

She has shown improvement in threshold and 100% she was able to get the in the room and focused in a timely manner using our reward bucks system however she dropped the ball with the lesson plan.  She did not provide a lesson plan until 5 am Thursday morning.  It was a similar lesson to the one I taught on Wednesday so she could have basically copied what I had with a few minor changes.  She tried to use the excuse that she was not familiar with the Math content but I told her that if she says something incorrect I would assist in that part of the lesson.  I was allowing her an opportunity to address some of the concerns in her previous observations.  The lesson was missing the we do component and she did not have the slides ready for the students.  She seemed to be unfamiliar with the difference between the I do, we do and you do even though this is common language in our school and how every teacher's lesson must have so she has been exposed to these different terms since September, She basically was not prepared even though the objective for the lesson was shared on google on Sunday 11/6 and told to her in person on Monday 11/7 to be taught on Thursday 11/10.  I went over each part the lesson providing her with the I do, We do and You do component of the lesson.  She was only responsible for teaching the I do and we do part of the lesson.  She claimed that it was because she had classes the Wednesday night and got home late.  

Overall she has shown more initiative in the classes and providing her input and ideas especially to the ESL students.  She seems more confident working one on one with students more than when she has to teach an entire class.  She needs to understand however the appropriate time to have conversations with students for example during the you do when the class is working on a task instead of when I am addressing the entire class and is in need of all the students attention so they have clarification on what they need to do to complete a task.","I reviewed the lesson quickly Thursday morning during my 1st period prep and gave feedback and identified missing parts of the lesson.  I reassured her that she needs to exude confidence and watch her timing during the lesson.  I reminded her that she was given the objective of the lesson well in advance and that she should have been more prepared.


I informed her that it was a clever idea having a student conduct the I do and it was able to work because it was a follow up lesson but it is not a strategy that will work in all classes / lessons.

I planned the lesson with her the day before providing her with the lesson objective. I do, we do and you do part of the lesson.  She was responsible for creating the exit ticket on her own.  This was in order to get her comfortable to the content of the class since I was aware that the transition was abrupt and she need time to adjust to her new setting.   She started the lesson well having all the students enter the room and ready for the lesson.  She however gave repetitive directions about calling on three students to summarize the lesson but never had a chance to accomplish that part of the lesson because the period was about to end before she started the I do part of the lesson.  I gave her the signal several times to pick up the pace but unfortunately it was unsuccessful.   She took too much time on the introduction of the lesson.

I did not ask Ms. Davis to teach my 1st period class because her observation was 4th period, so she had 2.5 hours to rehearse her lesson, and because based on my fellows needs I felt that Ms. Borgella needed to deliver her lesson to students rather than rehearse in isolation.  I had a prep 3rd period so could not offer Ms. Davis another class to deliver her lesson to before 4th period.

Ms. Davis also said she did not feel like she was being treated fairly because the other fellow (Ms. Borgella) told her that I had emailed Ms. Borgella a website over the weekend, and I did not email her (Ms. Davis) any websites over the weekend.  

She also said that she felt like she was not receiving the same support that Ms. Borgella was receiving from me.

She also said that she felt like she was being punished for arriving later than Ms. Borgella because she was missing out on conversations between Ms. Borgella and I before she arrived.  (I told both fellows to arrive by 7:30 am each day - Ms. Borgella typically arrives at 7:00 and Ms. Davis typically arrives at 7:30)","I told Ms. Davis that I would email her resources from NYCTF and elsewhere about the difference between fair and equal.  I explained that just like our students have different levels and require different types of support, the fellows have different strengths and areas of need, and therefore require different types of support.  I told her that I was not treating them equally because they were different in their needs, but that I was doing my best to treat them fairly by giving them the support that they needed.  

Ms. Davis continued to insist that she did not feel like she was being treated fairly.  I clarified the difference between fair and equal.  She said that we had different definitions of those words.  I told her that as a teaching fellow, the definitions of those words needed to be aligned with how NYCTF views those words.  She said that she was not talking about educating children, but was talking about how she felt.  I told her that as teachers, our #1 concern needs to be educating children and we should not take anything personally because we are focused on student achievement, not on ourselves.

Ms. Davis still continued to insist that she did not feel like she was being treated fairly.  I asked her if she wanted me to not allow Ms. Borgella to teach my 1st period class.  She said no.  I asked her if she had a suggestion because I did not have any other classes before 4th period.  She suggested that she deliver 15 minutes of her lesson and Ms. Borgella deliver 15 minutes of her lesson to my 1st period class.  I told her that was not an option, because the students are not guinea pigs and need to be taught a full lesson and not bits and pieces of separate lessons just to satisfy our wants/needs.  I reminded her that it was all about the students and student achievement.  Ms. Davis then requested that I not allow Ms. Borgella to teach my 1st period class then.  

She then requested that any email I send to Ms. Borgella I also send to her.  

She then requested that I not discuss anything with Ms. Borgella before she (Ms. Davis) arrives in the morning.

Details:

Ms. Davis was being observed by the FEM on Friday 10/28.  I found out that morning that I had to chaperone a field trip because the teacher that was supposed to was unable to.  So I asked my principal to cover my program for the 2 periods that my Fellows were teaching so that their observed lessons could run smoothly.

I emailed my Fellows this message:
""Good morning ladies,
I just found out that the teacher that was supposed to go on the 8th grade trip can no longer go, so they need me to go today.  Ms. Hudson will be with 6/7 all day, so during 2nd period and 8th period (your lessons) she will bring 6/7 over and be in the room with you while you have your lesson.  I know you will both do great and I am excited to hear how the lessons went.""

At 8:00, when the school day begins, Ms. Davis was not in my classroom and neither my other Fellow nor my paraprofessional had seen her.  I was concerned because I had not received an email from her about being absent or late, so at 8:30 I asked my other Fellow to take a look in the library to see if Ms. Davis was there, preparing for her lesson.  My other Fellow returned and said that she found Ms. Davis in the teacher's lounge.  At that point I had to leave for the field trip, so I did not get to see or speak to Ms. Davis.","I sent Ms. Davis an email saying:
""Hi Ms. Davis,
How did your lesson go today? I did not think you were at the school today because I did not see you this morning, but then I heard that you were in the teachers lounge. What time did you arrive today?""

I sent her an email on Friday - I said “I heard that you were in the teacher’s lounge” - she said that this was not professional.
She asked me if she could ask a student a question - she said that I sat right next to the student as she asked the question - this made her feel like I did not trust her and she felt this was disrespectful.

She said that it felt like I was not invested in her success - I said I found this highly offensive.
I said that we should continue this conversation with someone from NYCTF to mediate and that until then I only wanted to communicate via email and I would take over teaching class 6/7 math until this was resolved.","I reached out to Ben Zipf and he is going to come to my school to facilitate a conversation between the two of us.

At this point, I do not feel comfortable speaking with Ms. Davis without a supervisor from NYCTF and I do not feel comfortable having Ms. Davis teach my students if she is misunderstanding any of my words or actions as unprofessional or disrespectful, because I believe that indicates a lack of professionalism and critical thinking.",Deirdre Metcalf,msmetcalf5@gmail.com,Deirdre Metcalf,msmetcalf5@gmail.com,,,Marilyn Rodriguez,Marilyn.Rodriguez@nyctfops.org,Brooklyn College - Special Education 1-6

After debriefing with Ms. Sutherland, we both agreed that Ms. Davis scored 2s on all components of the observation rubric.  When I debriefed with Ms. Davis she started to cry a lot over her results. She said things like ""it was mathematically impossible"" for her to get into the hiring pool now.  ""The program is setting us up to fail"" and ""this is so unfair because they have different people observing us"".  She mentioned that her 2nd observation was also unfair because it was scheduled too soon after her first and that she was in a different position than other Fellows at the school because she was transferred in mid September.  She said she was going to fail and that she should probably quit.  She was crying continuously and shaking.  She raised her voice and said she did bad because the students did not go on ""bathroom break"".  Then she said the kids did fine and the lesson went well and that she has grown.  She also said this observation went much better than her 1st so she should have gotten some 3s.  ","I tried telling her that she can definitely make the cut, and that there was definite growth and a lot more time ahead to practice and get better.  After our debriefing session, she went to the bathroom to compose herself and told me she would like to talk to Ms. Sutherland privately.  I went back to the classroom and it was reported to me by other teachers that Ms. Davis waited for Ms. Sutherland in the hallway and seemed very distraught and crying.

I told her I was glad she had changed her mind and seemed in better spirits.  I briefly told her about having her plan her own lessons from now on so she can internalize them better.  She agreed and we decided to talk more about it later in the day.  At around 1:50 in the afternoon she came in from lunch and we continued our conversation.  I explained to her I would give her next week's objectives so she can start planning for her two full days of teaching.  I tried explaining to her that 1st period was going to be a little different because it wasn't going to be a full lesson period.  Students will do morning routines, unpack, and start with morning work or guided reading.  I was beginning to explain how I can model how to do a guided reading group and show her the flow of it.  She interrupted and said that she just needed 3 objectives for each day and that she will do the planning.  I tried explaining to her again that guided reading was a little different from a whole class lesson and a guided reading lesson had different components.  She interrupted before I could finish my sentence.  She said that the Fellows program offered her templates that she could use.  I said that's good, but I would also show her a template I used for guided reading lessons that she may want to use and manipulate her way.  Again, she cut in and interrupted and raised her voice, and said, ""I don't need you to show me anything.  What you've been giving me is not working for me, so I need to be creative and do my own thing.""  
","At this point, I decided to stop the conversation because she kept interrupting and in my opinion, had been blatantly disrespectful.  I told her that we can continue this meeting and talk more in a civil manner with Ms. Rodriguez (lead coach) present.  I got up to lock the classroom door as I was going to pick up the class from lunch.  I held the door for her.  She said, ""there's no need to slam the door on me.  I'm right behind you""  I told her I wasn't slamming any doors.  I let her walk out and closed the door behind me.  She continued upstairs and I went to the school yard to pick up my class.  I text Ms. Rodriguez immediately and debriefed her on this second incident after school.  

*Note:  I also met with Ms. Rodriguez this morning to discuss the incident that happened yesterday regarding Ms. Davis' observation and email this morning.  Ms. Rodriguez said she would meet with Ms. Davis sometime during the day.

The following is the email sent by Ms. Davis this morning at 7:44 am regarding yesterday's incident.

Elizabeth Davis to youshow details

Vicki, 

I want to apologize for yesterday. I was reacting in panic and not thinking clearly. I'm sorry. I was really unprofessional. In that moment, I was overwhelmed and it was hard to see the big picture. You're right, I still have time to get a high enough score on the last observation to pass. You were right, and also (!) so is Beyoncé: winners don't quit on themselves :). There's a lot of us in and out of the Fellows coping with too much stress. It's not just me. And just bc the system is unfair, as I believe it is not just for me but for everyone, I can adapt as ms k did, as the fellow across the hall who got the 3 did. 

And I regret having mentioned the bathroom break. Not their fault. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to make this better both between us and for the room. I'm on my way now and I will be right on time moving forward.

Ms. Rodriguez,  

Honestly, I don't like acting in such a reactionary way, it makes me feel frustrated with myself. But I can see, I'm coping destructively with the stress and I can't carry on this way. It's not that I expect to be so accomodated. Because I see other Fellows around me doing well.

Here are the issues: I couldn't cope with that first super long two hour commute and I feel like I fell behind. I was late a lot. I just started off on the wrong foot, adding to the trouble. I feel like the observations really boxed me in, in a negative way, and when they're conducted sort of in an arbitrary (different observers) and unfair (10 days apart) way, it really feels like I'm powerless to find a way to be successful, and so it's hard to be hopeful about it. And I have this interpersonal issue with my Coach, which is typical, but I haven't navigated very well. I don't know how to fix these things? Can I still come and talk with you at 8 a.m. sharp?

Ms Rodriguez, 
 
Thank you for the talk this morning and for your understanding and encouragement. Also, your class seems like a nice atmosphere. Your kids actually got to walk around and the blinds were open to the outside.
 
This morning, Ms. Herrera and I discussed the fact that I should be planning my own lessons. This has been happening a lot with the other Fellows. Coaches don’t want to let us plan, then we score poorly on observations. I thought she and I were on the same page—I explained to her that I’m not very good at rote memory and that I need to have ownership over the things that I’m teaching.
 
This afternoon, I again explained to her that I need to plan for three lessons next week. And she was thinking out loud. She was like well, I’ll have you do first period, but there’s not a lesson for that, just morning work. And I was like, well, okay I need to take periods where there are lessons. To plan. And then she again mentioned the morning work thing. And then she was like telling me I could do the guided reading at the end of next week. And I was like well it’s really going to be better if I can choose my own materials. So maybe you could just give me the objectives and I’ll plan around those. And she hedged. It just, to me, seemed like a lot of excuses. Also, maybe it is just a clash of personalities? Listen, I have two master's degrees, when I did my MFA, a room full of people openly criticized my work. I am used to peer review. But this is just like, I feel criticized at my core by her, like just kind of generally disliked. And I was just like, well you know, like whatever the common core standards are for next week. I’ll plan around the objectives and then you can take a look at my plan. 
 
And then she showed me her lesson plan graphic for guided reading? And she was like, you should observe me first. And I was like, I’m going to use the lesson plan templates that the Fellows gave us and plan around that. I need to use my own creativity. And then she said, well, but have you ever seen a lesson plan for a guided reading. You should follow mine.

I feel like she treats me like I'm one of the students. I'm an adult. 
 
I do not feel comfortable returning to her classroom as her student teacher. To be clear, I prefer to quit the Fellows over return to her classroom. This morning, she told a student, Jeremy (student who needs IEP!): “let me see your forced smile.” Then she repeated “forced smile” at least three more times. That’s unacceptable. A teacher does not tell a student how to feel in front of a room of his peers. Kids have negative feelings, everybody does. Nobody is required to pretend like he is okay. Also, she disrespects her co-teacher’s contributions. She openly criticized to me her co-teacher’s methods behind her backs. Makes me uncomfortable. Unacceptable and disrespectful.
 
What I would like now is to contact the Fellows and ask them to switch me to a different Coach. In the mean time, I’d like the opportunity to come to your class to observe you. Because I don't want to just skip days of work, wasting my time, not learning. But, if they won’t switch me; however, I’ll leave. I’m tired of trying super hard to no effect. I really like the kids and I love seeing the way they learn. But these weeks have been really terrible on a personal level and I'm sick of it. I honestly don't know if it's worth it to continue, the way that it's dragging me down.

How can we simultaneously be graded according to the Fellows scale AND navigate around a Coach's classroom that is basically on the opposite end of the requirements of the Fellows' scale? That is an impossible expectation and it's maddening and it's crazy-making, truth be told.

Please let me know about tomorrow. Thank you!

Good Evening Lizette,


There was a lack of professionalism that was demonstrated by the Fellow in question that is simply intolerable. As a mentoring program, we expect candidates to be arrive onsite, prepared to work, as modeled by our staff (the Collaborative Coaches). Despite several attempts to keep her awake during class, she was consistently drowsed, which raises concerns about her commitment as a supervisor of students. I regret to inform you of this decision, but I strenuously object to this lack of professionalism and care, especially when it has become habitual from the first day of her arrival.

Our commitment to the program remains strong, and we look forward to other candidates who will learn as much as they contribute to our professional learning community.

Thank you for your understanding.

I hope you had a great weekend!

It was great spending some time in your class and observing the work that you have been doing with Stephanie!

I know that Stephanie has already provided you with feedback. However, I also wanted to provide you with feedback and next steps. Below you will find a few glows and grows, and next steps:

Glows

-Your lesson was engaging, you allowed students to answer questions as a whole group and work collaboratively. The lesson was also differentiated to meet the needs of different learners. I understand that you received feedback from Stephanie on the lesson, and you implemented that feedback to improve your lesson. Nice work!

-I observed a few students calling out during your lesson, when they did this you said "" If you have a question raise your hand"". Nice job setting the expectation for the behavior that you want to see.

-I observed you being receptive to the feedback Stephanie gave you during your feedback conversation. This was great to see as it is an important part of the growth process.

Grows

- As Stephanie mentioned to you during your feedback conversation, it is important to make the connection for the students. You should also answer the ""why?"" for your students during the lesson. For example, if you are teaching the students that when X planet is facing the sun it is day time....teach the students why. This provides a deeper level of understanding.

-During your feedback conversation I observed that you were not taking notes. You should be taking notes during any feedback conversation that you have with Stephanie regarding your teaching practice. Taking notes will give you a point of reference when you begin planning your next lesson. You will have a record of what you are doing well and what you need to improve on. You can also refer back to your notes with specific questions for Stephanie if needed.

Next Steps:

1.Take feedback from each coaching session/ conversation and implement it in to your instructional practice.

2.Take notes at any future coaching conversations.

Please let me know if you have any questions!",Odette Clarke,OClarke5@schools.nyc.gov,Stefanie Greco,sgreco4@schools.nyc.gov,,,Marilyn Rodriguez,Marilyn.Rodriguez@nyctfops.org,Pace University - District 75 (7-12)

Since observing her on 11/ 3, I have had additional feedback from the the CC and the Principal and want to document this information.

Per Stefanie (CC), Elizabeth had been resistant to feedback during the semester. I also saw this resistance to feedback when I met with Elizabeth after she was placed on a PIP by her FEM Kelsey. When I met with Elizabeth (right after she was placed on a PIP) she did not seem to agree with Kelsey's feedback. She seemed upset about being put on a PIP. She thought she had done a good job during the observation. After this meeting I decided to come back and observe her the following week on 11/3. During the coaching conversation she was much more receptive to Stefanie's feedback (her CC)..... it seemed. After speaking with Stefanie, Stefanie agreed that she was much more receptive. However, Stefanie felt that this was only because I was there to observe the feedback conversation. Since 11/ 3 I have checked in with Stefanie to see how Elizabeth is doing. Although Stefanie reported that she is doing better, on 11/21 Stefanie advised that she feels that Elizabeth ""just doesn't get it""....she went on to explain that Elizabeth went on a visit to another site and commented that ""this is gloried babysitting"". Stefanie feels that Elizabeth ""just doesn't get SPED""...Stefanie went on to say ""I don't think this is for her"" ""I don't think that she realizes how much these students need"".

I am very concerned about the comments from this Fellow. I also have experienced some concerning comments from Elizabeth first hand. For example, when I met with her after she was put on a PIP by Kelsey, and I tried to help her see the PIP as a tool to be used for improvement. She said to me ""Have you ever worked in D 75!?


In addition, on 11/15 I received an email from the Principal..please see below for excerpts from that email:

I have some concerns about Elizabeth Gloeggler as she seems to be really saying negative things about my teacher, Stefanie Greco, when she takes part in the classroom part (outside of my school) of this experience.  Stefanie Greco is an excellent teacher who has been rated ""highly effective"" for the 2015-16 school year.  She is a hard worker who prepares for her class and she consistently delivers excellent lessons to her students.  She told me there have been issues w/ Ms. Gloeggler in the classroom, which makes me think Ms. Gloeggler may not be the best teaching candidate for a school.

The ongoing concerns and comments from both the Coach and Principal and what I have witnessed myself makes me very concerned about this Fellow.

The actions and comments above are unprofessional. They also don't represent the growth mindset that I feel is needed by a first year teacher in the classroom. 


Please consider this as you make final decisions on Fellows during these final days of the program.

She asked how this letter would impact her standing in The Fellows Program. I advised that in the next few days she would hear from The Fellows regarding her standing and that at this time I could not give her any other information on the impact this letter would have.

Elizabeth then went on to say the following:
-She says that she does not know where this is coming from.
-She says that she did not make the comment “glorified babysitting”, but that Stephanie (her coach) actually made that statement…...Elizabeth says that she would not say something like this.
-She explained that she has family members with disabilities, and it has been her dream to work in D75.
-She mentioned that she wanted to teach more, but Stefanie (her coach) didn’t want her to.
-She explained that she was heartbroken that she couldn’t be at school today and feels bad that she did not get to say goodbye to her students.
-She wished that she would have had some actions to take in this situation.
-Elizabeth says that Stephanie told her that she accepted feedback very well.
-Elizabeth says that she loves the program and speaks highly of the program. She says she would take a D75 class any day, she says she truly loved these kids 
 

I plan to have a follow up conversation with Stephanie after next week when we return from the holiday break.

Thank you all for your support in this matter.","

Thanks for talking briefly with me today about the professional dress. Because those pants appear to be jeans I appreciate you no longer wearing them during PST. Professional dress allows you to always put your best foot forward when being viewed by other teachers and administrators who could offer you positions.

They were very unclear, and sometimes hard to read. She came into SBS on Monday October 31st, which I was surprised to see her there. In class, she did not engage much, and has never been prepared. During practice, she had five minutes to practice ""Control the Game"". I asked her several times to begin and she never did. She struggled to read the passage given in the book and had copied her EW and expectations speech from her partner. 

After class I asked to speak with her and she said ""7th grade math was too hard and she can't be expected to learn it"" and this wouldn't be a problem because ""elementary school content would be easier"". 

Generally, I am concerned with Sha-Mecca's lack of progress, her functioning in class, her lack of professionalism (even in emailing or not being prepared for class) and her struggle with basic content.

He also threatened to quit the program several times.

I told will I thought he was acting in an unprofessional manner and that I would not speak with him until he could calm down. He calmed down slightly and I explained that I had also noticed him pulling a student in my classroom, which I addressed with him previously. I explained that teachers and staff at 373 do not pull or push students into instructional positions, but instead use reinforcers or prompts. 

I also told him that it is inappropriate to have loud disagreements with other fellows or staff in front of students. I told him to address all non-emergency concerns when there are no students around. 
I also told him that I am very concerned by his professionalism during instructional lunch and especially during our conversation. I explained that there will be many times in ones teaching career where you do not agree with a supervisor or staff member but that you still need to act as a professional and remain calm. I told will that his classroom teacher has expressed that she believes he is doing very well and that I'm hopeful he will continue to do well in and outside his class, only use 373 and Nyctf 6:1:1 strategies and act as a professional at all times.

Hi Hilarie,

Sorry I lost my temper with you this morning. I could have presented my thoughts more cogently or tried to find a time for that. I actually appreciated your approach in class once I got a handle on it. I also understand the other fellows motivations and desire to do well.  I think she will be an excellent teacher.

Will, 

Thank you for the email! It was very thoughtful and I appreciate hearing your concerns and reflection. 
I also wanted to thank you for taking the time to talk with me today about such a sensitive topic. 

As we discussed, training can be a challenging experience, but please keep in mind that the NYCTF essential professional traits compliment each part of your training. You and I share the same end goal, which is to fully prepare you to meet the wide range of needs of your students!  

Part of being a teacher is learning how to communicate your concerns and opposing viewpoints to your supervisors and administration. I am concerned by your lack of professionalism during our conversation this morning. There may be times that you disagree with a supervisor and I want to encourage to express any concerns going forward, but it is extremely important to remember to be aware of your tone and body language while expressing yourself.

Once again, this situation has nothing to do with any of the Fellows in the program. My concern was that the methods you were using during instructional lunch were too forceful and not aligned with the behavioral management strategies we use at 373k. Going forward, I know you will be more aware and continue to work well with your students. 

I look forward to working with you and I'm confidant that the rest of training will be a positive learning experience for students, staff and Fellows!

Thank you Hilarie. I am sorry for losing it a little the last couple of days. Today I can see more clearly how my loss of temper exacerbated that situation in the lunchroom and how the politics are complex, that obviously I am the least adept person in there and everyone has a different take and approach.

Hi Will,

I hope that watching me model all of today's lessons put things better into focus for you. Starting next week, I'd like you to begin to submit your lesson plans. Please submit Monday and Tuesdays lesson plans by 8pm on Sunday. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday by Tuesday at 8pm. Your lessons should have the stories or videos you plan to use and all the worksheets as well. If you like, you can submit  paper copies of worksheets in person the day before they are due. Seeing your lesson plans will help me to coach you better since I'll see your thought process in lesson preparation better. Tomorrow I'll give you a printout of this month's curriculum map so it can give you some guidelines. Please keep the kids IEP goals and communication systems in mind when creating your lessons. I'd also like for you to plan questions that you'd like to ask while keeping communication systems in mind. 

As a reminder, you'll have 8th period to prepare for your lessons. You're only teaching 1 period this week and next week in addition to the morning routine. We'll touch base everyday after the lesson so that I can give you some feedback. Structured teaching is very difficult in the beginning but I'm confident I can help you!

Mr. Mejia's social media privacy settings were in place to maintain professionalism, but the video was obtained through a student's parent's Facebook. Several students reported to the dean that Mr. Mejia approached them in the cafeteria to discourage their behavior. They stated that they felt ""threatened"" by Mr. Mejia's comments.  The dean communicated the incident to the parents of each student involved, as well as to the administration. Mr. Mejia and his coach, Ms. Del Rosario, participated in a conference with the dean and students, and the issue was deemed to be resolved. I was informed of this process, and Mr. Mejia continued his instruction without interacting with the aforementioned students. 

On Friday, November 18, following her class with Mr. Mejia, one student approached the dean and requested that she contact her father. The dean stopped at my classroom to bring me into the conversation. The dean stated that the student was upset, that she felt threatened and disrespected. Ms. Reiss, the principal, contacted our Site Manager, Ms. Wineland. After approaching Ms. Del Rosario, it came to light that the student had not approached her at any time during instruction. No student in the class had indicated any discomfort or negative emotion. Ms. Del Rosario and her mother, who was visiting the classroom as a presenter that day, stated that they did not observe any inappropriate behavior from Mr. Mejia, and that he had very limited interaction with the student in question. Ms. Del Rosario's mother was sitting in this particular student's group. Both women reported that the class appeared to be enjoying the lesson, and that there were moments of laughter and demonstration of positive teacher-student rapport. I communicated this information to Ms. Wineland and Ms. Reiss. Ms. Del Rosario and I had a brief conference with Ms. Reiss. We confirmed that Mr. Mejia would be able to complete his program at Evergreen.

Thank you for sharing your concern with me earlier today regarding Mr. Casey Pena.

I want to make sure I have all of the facts before I forward the concern to the Fellows office.

During the week of 9/26 Mr. Pena was observed on his cell phone and sitting with his seat propped up on a desk during a staff meeting. When the assistant principal addressed the issue with Mr. Penk he became agitated and outwardly insubordinate in front of other staff members.

Good afternoon Mr. Penk,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. 

I just want to follow-up on what we discussed at the meeting. I discussed with you what was brought to my attention recently. During a PLC meeting you were observed on your cell phone and that you were sitting with your legs up. When the assistant principal addressed this issue, you became agitated and outwardly insubordinate. You stated that you recall using your cell phone during a PLC meeting but you can’t recall putting your feet up on a desk. You also mentioned that at one point you were on your cell phone reading the common core standards. Additionally, you stated that it was not your intention to disrespect the AP or the staff members.

Moving forward you stated that you will be more conscious about the way you conduct yourself as a professional and a member of the school community-that you stay on task during PLC meetings.

If you have questions please see or email me.
 
Thank you,
Mr. Pasco

She was insisting that Curtis (the other fellow I am hosting) splits that day with her to teach. I told her that we want to respect the scope and sequence of the Fellow’s in which you teach 1 whole day and not share with Curtis. She pushed back a little regarding this decision but eventually agreed as to what needed to get done. 
We agreed and constantly ask her for her “next steps” & deliverables. She verbatim repeats them to me before we dismiss. Carmen reiterated her deliverables to me and ended the conversation",I mentioned to Carmen clear directions and expectations for the deliverables that will be due and when she needs to provide for me a lesson plan for a quiz that I HAVE ALREADY CREATED. Meaning all she had to do was write WTD directions and how the day will look in the teaching fellows lesson plan template. ,Sohail Qureshi,Sohail.Qureshi@nyctfops.org,Marlowe Knipes,Marlowe.Knipes@nyctfops.org,,,Marilyn Rodriguez,Marilyn.Rodriguez@nyctfops.org,Brooklyn College - Special Education 1-6

I mentioned i have no control over this but she still insisted that her & Curtis switch days. She mentions to me via text to switch her day to thursday instead of Wednesday even though she has ample time to prepare. She messages me saying at 9:34pm Saturday night stating  “Give him all of Wednesday and I get all of Thursday. Especially since i haven’t been home all day and haven’t gotten started on it (the lesson plan) anyway”
Carmen is clearly opting out from her deliverable which is due the next day Sunday 9am due to the fact that she not been home and has not started. Carmen has chronic issues with turning in lesson plans on time and meeting the deadlines. I then explain to Carmen that if she needs an extension for Monday 9am she can have it. She still remained pretty upset towards this matter and was upset because she believed that Curtis would be observed during her time and that her lesson would have gotten rated pre novice. I clarified for her that Curtis will be handing in his own lesson that he has created for thursday which he will deliver on wednesday during his observation. Carmen still fought back and did not respond with an affirmative to meet the deadline or not. Carmen was challenging my scope and sequence for my classroom and thought it was no big deal to switch fellows or lesson plans for the day. Carmen tried to opt out from creating this lesson and seemed upset in the text message conversation. 
Carmen mentioned to me in a text message stating that since Curtis's observation date has been changed, ""I'm assuming this means I will not be creating the lesson plan for Wednesday as it will be Curtis now.""
THIS WAS A FALSE ASSUMPTION. CARMEN HAS NO RIGHT TO ASSUME SOMETHING REGARDING A DELIVERABLE UNLESS I PERSONALLY TELL HER IF THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE. SHE ASSUMED AND WAS NOT PREPARED AND WAS OUT ALL DAY. ""I've been out all day""

I want to make note that 4 straight weeks Carmen has had some sort of issue with submitting lesson plans on time and she reverts to blaming me for things being unclear when I have always made myself available to contact and my other Fellow has been meeting ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS. ",I texted her on a saturday night trying to clarify the situation but Carmen was still irate. The real issue is that Carmen surprisingly once again is not prepared and will not be meeting the deadline of lesson plan submission by sunday 9am. I led with empathy and extended her time after I clarified to her why she was still going to teach wednesday and Curtis was still going to teach thursday. She was not happy with my response because it challenged her to create the lesson still. I extended Carmen's due date for the lesson plan for 9am monday to give her time to figure out what she needs to do. ,Sohail Qureshi,Sohail.Qureshi@nyctfops.org,Marlowe Knipes,Marlowe.Knipes@nyctfops.org,,,Marilyn Rodriguez,Marilyn.Rodriguez@nyctfops.org,Brooklyn College - Special Education 1-6

He mentioned that her deliverables are still due and she is still acceptable for them. TAKE NOTE THAT CARMEN WAS STILL DUE A LESSON PLAN ON MONDAY 9AM. ,I responded to Ben with frustration because I have consistently mentioned Carmen's inability to be professional and no measures were taken but now it seems like we have given her a chance to opt out once again making the situation seem as it is my fault which hides and distracts the average person from knowing that Carmen is not suited to be a teacher due to her questionable work ethic. Ben mentioned that he needs to what is in the best interest for the Fellow. i mentioned to Ben that my TT2 has not been working other wise I would have FYI'd everything. He told me that it was my responsiblity to make sure that I reached out to fix that portal. So I mentioned to Ben that i have been keeping a running log regarding my issues with Carmen and i will submit it first thing monday when my TT2 is fixed.

Hi!

Sorry I missed this. Please use my school email mknipes@bronxparkms.info for our communications.

As for scheduling, please plan to attend each school day that teachers attend including PD days. You can refer to the NYC DOE calendar for holidays. On regular school days my student interns arrive at 8:00, and my fellows arrive at 7:30 to prepare for classes. Given that you are in the final weeks of the program and must reorient to a social studies classroom, I suggest that you arrive at 7:30 to prepare for the day and pose clarifying questions should you have any. I will mark you on time and present if you arrive by 8:00am. Please let me know if this poses a challenge to you.

Best,

Knipes

Conversation when Ms Ramos arrived late (8:13 am, Wednesday 11/9) in which I referenced the above Email.
Ms Ramos responded that her car was in an accident at some earlier time.
I responded that teachers are responsible for their students growth and must therefore not be late to class.",Marlowe Knipes,Marlowe.Knipes@nyctfops.org,Marlowe Knipes,Marlowe.Knipes@nyctfops.org,,,Marilyn Rodriguez,Marilyn.Rodriguez@nyctfops.org,Brooklyn College - Special Education 1-6

When Ms Ramos sent a text saying that she might be late (""Im hitting some major delays. Trying to get there as soon as I can but not much I can do""), I replied asking her to check in with me as soon as she arrived to ensure accurate attendance.
Ms Ramos sent me a text claiming that she was at school at 8:00, but I did see her until 8:09.

I spoke with her about having responsibility for children and that being present is critical to ensure the safety of her students.
