How does Pollan make a convincing argument for the local sustainable food chain?  How does Pollan make a convincing argument for the hunter/gatherer food chain?  These questions required the students to analyze and support their answers with evidence.    3c.  Ms. Silfrene used a variety of techniques and strategies to engage her students.  The use of the text: The Omnivore's Dilemma – The Secrets Behind What You Eat by Michael Pollan ""matched the students reading skill level and interests.  This text was incorporated into the lesson to provide the source of the evidence for the students to cite in order to back up their claims. In addition, Ms. Silfrene used the: I do, we do, you do model to insure student understanding and their successful completion of the classroom activity.  The use of a turn and talk and a group activity with pre-selected group members based on their skills and abilities insured the engagement of all of the students in the class throughout the lesson.

This objective was aligned with the Common Core Standards for integration of Knowledge and Ideas.  Specifically: #3. Follow precisely a complex multistep procedure when carrying out experiments, taking measurements, or performing technical tasks; analyzing the specific results based on explanations and #9. Synthesize information from a range of sources (e.g., text, experiments, simulations, maps) into a coherent understanding of a process, phenomenon, or concept.   1e:  Nailah and her partner designed a coherent lesson including a do now activity, a mini-lesson introducing the topic of triangulation, a group activity and a Summary Activity.  There was attention paid to differentiate in assessing the students responses in the Do Now and Group Activity, the assignment of students into groups based upon ability and the specific listing of 5 different duties that were to be individually assigned for each group member to insure the engagement of all in the activity.   The handouts (Triangulate the Epicenter, Seismic Stations and P & S Waves Times worksheet) were all clear and tiered for different students.  The final product of the group activity was completed on a  ""poster size"" sheet, to allow for display and assessment by the other class groups.  A variety of questions were planned and asked to insure that students understood the activity's steps and content.  The Gallery Walk at the end of the lesson allowed each group to assess another group's work and use post-it notes to make critical comments on their classmates' work.   In addition, the use of the Earth Science Review Table provided exposure to and practice with a tool that is essential to earning a passing grade on the formal assessment of the NY State Earth Science Regents Exam",Highly Effective,Highly Effective,Effective+,"2b. The culture for learning in this class was clearly established as safe and welcoming with high expectations for student achievement set.  Ms. Walters-Spencer and her partner have an excellent rapport with these 34 students.  The students seem to trust that the teachers have their best interests at heart.  The respect that these students have for these two teachers was clearly evident in their cooperation and focus throughout the lesson.   2c. The class ran smoothly with established procedures being followed.  The students' swift transition to working on the do now activity, (less than one minute) was very impressive.   Students were required to sign the Late Log and the Bathroom log.  Hands were raised to answer questions and to volunteer to write on the board.  Materials were distributed effectively at the start and the end of the lesson.  Students moved quickly and effectively as they traded places with their neighboring group to assess their work and returned to their original stations just as smoothly for the summarizing class share-out. 2d. The students' behavior was appropriate.  They followed instructions and remained on task throughout the lesson.   They needed some refocusing when shifting from the do now to the group activity, however once Ms. Walters-Spencer stated "" I'm hearing voices…. I'm still hearing voices"" the students re-focused and were ready to receive the instructions for their group activity.",Effective+,Effective+,Highly Effective,"3b.  Nailha and her partner used a variety of questions throughout the lesson that were all pre-planned and written in their detailed lesson plan.  The Essential Question was:  How do we use S and P waves to locate the epicenter of an earthquake?  The Pivotal/Leading & Discussion Questions: were:  Using your prior knowledge of locating the epicenter, what do you notice about this map?  According to your knowledge of finding the epicenter, what steps will student A need to edit to be able to locate the epicenter?  How can you recognize that the arrival times are correct?      The summary questions required that the students analyze their results from the group activity in order to be answered.  The summary questions included:  Which city is closest to the epicenter?  How far is New York from the epicenter?  Which of the cities listed in the data table would have become aware of the earthquake?  Which seismic station from the data table was farthest from the epicenter?  3c.  Nailah and her partner used a variety of techniques and strategies to engage their students.  The do now the activity handouts were clear, graphic and allowed enough space for calculations and student responses.  The SMARTBOARD was used throughout the lesson to list the aim, objective, activity-steps, individualized group member assignments and to display the activity sheets both before and after completion.  The activity steps were displayed in a large font on the Smartboard to appeal to the students' visual strengths and were both consecutively numbered and color-coded to allow for easy comprehension by all of the students in the class.  Both the teachers and students circled their responses to the epicenter locations of the activities.    The activity was ""hands-on"" using calculators and compasses.  The seven groups were pre-selected based upon academic ability.  The activity tasks were differentiated based on ability level and specific aspects of the task were individually assigned to students.  The workshop model was employed in this lesson, providing the students with three opportunities (""I do, We do, You do"") to master the concepts introduced.   The summary activity allowed the students from one group to examine the work of another group and provide feedback on post-it notes.  3d.  Ms. Walters-Spencer and her partner moved around the room as the students worked on the class activities, to encourage, assist and clarify for them.  She entered a grade on her daily hand held chart for the areas of behavior and participation.  She evaluated and responded to the student responses to questions posed.  The group activity ""peer check"" was also quite effective in having the student groups assess the work of another group.",Effective+,"Ms. Walters- Spencer commented correctly on the effectiveness of her lesson in the areas of questioning, working as a co-teaching team, and creating a poster sized data sheet to engage her students visually.  She also identified the lesson timing as an area that needs improvement, noting that the Do Now could have taken less time if the number of steps were shortened.

In addition the CCSS standards of RL3, RL4, RL5 and RL9 were also a focus of the lesson that Ms. Jamison and her partner Ms. McIntyre planned and executed.  1c:  The outcomes of this lesson were clearly stated:  From the play, Fences, the students will 1. Characterize Troy, Gabriel and Rose and identify supporting evidence.  2. Complete a close reading of pages 21-28. 3.  Discuss issues surrounding the stigma of mental illness.  4. Explore more allusions found in the play.   1e:  Ms. Jamison and her co-teaching partner Ms. McIntyre designed a coherent lesson using the play, Fences. The lesson included a do now, which focused on the topic of mental illness, what it looks like and how it should be treated.""  This was followed by a close reading of Act One, Scene 2 with three focus questions provided prior to the activity, followed by the provision of some information on mental illness and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), a group discussion activity on the reasons POC have a fear/stigma about seeking professional help for mental illness, a share-out, a summary, an exit ticket and a double-entry journal homework assignment.",Highly Effective,Highly Effective,Highly Effective,"2b. The culture for learning in this class was clearly established as safe and welcoming with high expectations for student achievement set by Ms. Jamison and Ms. McIntyre.  Students eagerly volunteered to read aloud as the three main characters and narrator; thoughtfully answered the questions posed to them, respectfully listened to the responses of their fellow classmates and used ""accountable talk"" in commenting back.  The students were all eagerly engaged in the do-now turn and talk activity as well as the group activity with no coercion needed by the teachers.  2c. The class ran smoothly with established procedures being followed.   The 32 students settled into the class in under one minute, ready to begin the do-now activity displayed on the Smartboard.  There was no time wasted at the start of this lesson.   2d. The students' behavior was appropriate.  They followed instructions and remained on task throughout the lesson.  As there were several pair and group activities planned, Ms. Jamison needed to re-focus the class after each one.  All that was required of her was to say: ""Let' s come back together.  All eyes on me"" and the students were ready for the next instruction.",Highly Effective,Highly Effective,Effective+,"3b. Ms. Jamison and Ms. McIntyre were very effective in their use of questions and creating classroom discussion.   A variety of questions were planned and asked throughout the lesson.  They challenged the students on many levels of thinking and the students responded correctly and thoughtfully and initiating class discussions.  Some examples of these questions are:  The Essential Question of the lesson was ""Who or what defines our identity""? The do-now questions asked: ""What does mental illness look like""? How should it be treated""?  The focus questions during the close reading of Act 1, Scene 2 were:  What else do we learn about each of the characters?  2. What are their relationships to each other? And 3. Are there any predictions that we can make?   The discussion following the viewing of the video clip of the TV series Empire included the questions:  ""What is Andre's family reaction to his mental illness?  Why does Andre's family want him to quit going to therapy""?  ""Why do you think POC have fear/stigmas about seeking professional help for mental illness""?   The students were required to identify allusions to the Bible and religion in Act 1, Scene 2 of Fences such as: Rose is a very religious character, ""Jesus be a fence"" and Gabriel is the messenger angel.   Finally the students were asked to address one of the following four questions in their exit ticket:  1.  What are your impressions of Gabriel?   2. What is the relationship between Troy and Gabriel?  3. What are Troy's feelings about Gabriel's mental illness? And 4. How does mental illness affect the family?   3c.  Ms. Jamison and her co-teaching partner used a variety of techniques and strategies to engage the students. Instructions for the activities, objectives, the exit ticket, the homework and the class questions were displayed on the Smartboard throughout the lesson.  Graphics on the physical, emotional and cognitive impairments of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and the statistics of the prevalence of mental illness within the black community in the USA were displayed on the Smartboard.  The video clip of the scene from the TV series Empire dealing with a character's mental illness was also shown on the Smartboard.   This selection of this clip was an excellent way to engage the students as it was relevant to the students' experience (hip-hop music) and was a show that this class of African American students were all familiar with and had watched.   The use of a turn and talk activity in the do now was an effective technique to use during the ""prime time"" of the lesson to ""hook"" all the students in the class in order to engage them from the very beginning of the lesson.   The share out time after the do now, close reading and group activity provided the opportunity for the students to express their responses and to comment on those of their classmates using "" accountable talk"".  Student volunteers were assigned to read aloud the parts of the major characters and the narrator while the rest of the class followed along during the close reading of Act 1, Scene 2 of Fences.    The students worked in six groups that were pre-assigned according to their ability.  By offering 4 choices to the students for creating the product of the group activity and also allowing the each student to choose one of the four exit ticket questions, Ms. Jamison and Ms. McIntyre insured the engagement of ALL of the students in the class activities. 3d.  Assessment is a focus for Ms. Jamison during the Spring 2017 term and listed on her Collaborative Plan.  She displayed effectiveness in this area during this lesson.  Assessment was built into the lesson plan in the form of Formative assessments, dialogue and read-alouds, teacher circulation, an exit slip, student –to- student feedback, comprehension questions, clarifying questions, a group project and a homework assignment.   Ms. Jamison and Ms. McIntyre moved around the room as the students worked on the class activities, to encourage, assist and clarify for them.  In addition, the student teacher and the paraprofessional also assisted, insuring that the six groups were constantly supervised and assessed.  During a share-out from the video, Ms. Jamison opened up the responses to make it a full class discussion as a result of the students' enthusiastic responses and interest.   The prepared questions that were asked of the students provided many opportunities to assess their understanding of the information presented in the lesson. The students were asked to write their reactions to the video in an effort to summarize it. The group project and exit ticket responses also provided information for the teachers to assess their students' level of understanding of the lesson.  Finally, the homework assignment required the students to write double-entry journals of Act 1, Secne 2 providing another opportunity for the students to express their understanding of the lesson topic.",Effective+,"Ms. Jamison commented correctly on the areas of her teaching that were effective in this lesson.  She indicated her strength in establishing and enforcing classroom routines plus the creation of a safe and respectful classroom environment allows her to expect that her students be active listeners and use accountable talk during classroom discussions.   This sets the tone for eliminating behavioral issues in the class.  She also felt that she was successful in engaging the students by differentiating the products of the class activities by incorporating student choice in the selection of the type of product to be created for each activity. Ms. Jamison also indicated that she and her partner incorporated the use of the Smartboard most effectively in this lesson to appeal to the visual strengths of their students, by displaying questions, instructions, charts and videos to engage their class.

In the Warm Up students were asked to reflect on the following three questions: What is the central idea of your story? The theme?, Who are the protagonists and what are their points of view?,What was the tone or mood? Why? During the Warm Up the homework was checked and the attendance taken. After about 5 minutes Ms. Esser-Munera asked the students for a definition of a protagonist, allowed them to turn and talk to remind them of the answer, and got the definition after that—the main character. She then asked what an antagonist was and got the answer—the enemy. She asked what the difference between tone and mood was and got the answer—tone is the author's feeling while mood is the reader's feeling. No time was taken to explore the answers, to connect to previous knowledge, to ask clarifying questions. She then moved on to the lesson. The answers that the students had written to the Warm Up questions were never shared. The Aim for the day was ""I can revise my central idea and analyze key ideas. I can understand the structure of a story."" This Aim was not addressed during the lesson. The Focus question was ""How can we use writing stories to help us understand the structure of stories when reading them? Students were asked to paraphrase what this meant. Someone did.  Students were asked to exchange their stories with a partner and to read and label the parts of a plot structure that appeared in their partner's story—opening, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution. Students were sitting in rows of three so one student in each row did not have a partner. During the peer review Ms. Esser-Munera conferenced with individual students at their desks. During this work and conferencing time the students who were working independently finished quickly, and had nothing to do but talk to each other. Constant disciplinary action was required to keep the noise down. There was no written or oral accountability for the work accomplished. As an exit ticket students were asked to write one thing their partner did well, ask them one question, and suggest one improvement that could be made. When they finished their exit ticket they brought their notebook up for Ms. Esser-Munera to read. There was no sharing. They left when the bell rang.   It was unclear was what exactly the students were supposed to learn. What were they supposed to know at the end of the class about revising the central idea or analyzing key ideas? What outcomes were expected?",Developing+,Developing,Effective,"This was the last period of the day and the students were antsy.

The Do Now was a visual review of the medieval period, the historical period preceding the Renaissance in Europe. Two pictures that depicted scenes from the Renaissance were projected on the screen and students were directed to compare what they knew about feudalism to the projected images. The prompt was, ""How are these pictures similar or different from what we know about medieval times?"" After students wrote, they shared what they know about feudalism and noted the differences between the prosperity seen in the Renaissance images and the devastation caused by the black plague at the end of the medieval period. They displayed an enormous amount of factual information and almost everyone in the class was eager to add to the review. Ms. Haynes asked the students to think about what could happen after the Black Plague killed 1/3 of the population of Europe. This segued into the lecture that introduced the Renaissance. Ms. Haynes told the students that during the week they were going to learn about the Renaissance in Europe. She had prepared a series of Power Point slides that outlined the highlights of the period and as she expanded on the information on each slide, students diligently took notes.  At the end of the period she put the homework reading assignment on the board and the prompt for the Exit Ticket. ""How did we get from the end of the Middle Ages to the Renaissance? Was your prediction right? What major events happened?"" The prompt was confusing and when she noticed the students' restlessness, she took time to clarify and explain.

Students were eager to participate and made unsolicited connections to what they were learning in their English class about important figures in the Renaissance.  Most students contributed to the class discussion, but more wanted to.  The pacing needed to be brisk, but to allow more voices to be heard let the students speak in turn before the teacher speaks at the end of the answer response time and with a summary of what was said and a connection to what will follow in the lesson. Also, to help students formulate their own questions while keeping up the brisk pace, ask more challenging rhetorical questions at different points of the lecture that connect to the lessons that will follow during the week.Assessments were used at the beginning and the end of the period. Feudalism was reviewed and Ms. Haynes praised the students for their high quiz grades from the week before.  An Exit slip monitored the students' thinking. When it was obvious that the students were confused by the exit slip prompt the directions were clarified and guidance on how to organize the answer's information was provided. Students were then able to be successful in completing the assessment.",Effective,"Ms. Haynes knew that this was a very good lesson, and we were able to discuss ways that it could have been made even better.

The students had just completed reading Rabbit Proof Fence and were about to read an excerpt from ""Behind The Beautiful Forevers.""  During our last conference, we both expressed concern because this text was really not appropriate for Mr.  Dawson's students who are all ENL's.  This text is challenging for several reasons:  First, it takes place in Mumbai and the students have little prior knowledge of India or conditions in the slums of Mumbai.  Also, the main character is much older than the students, where as in Rabbit Proof Fence, the main character is close to the students' age.  Finally, there is a lot of difficult and unfamiliar vocabulary.  Mr. Dawson wanted to substitute a more accessible text, however, he was not permitted to do so by the administration.    I was anxious to see how Mr. Dawson would provide scaffolding for the students and he did an excellent job.  It started with his highly articulated lesson which had a clear and focused objective that set a purpose for the learning.  Students would be closely reading the text for the purpose of determining how narrative techniques advance and enhance the story.    The lesson began with a do now that displayed the cover of the book ""Behind The Beautiful Forevers.""  Students were asked to predict what the text would be about.  Using visuals gave support to ENL's and visual learners.  The students were also asked to predict what role the setting, the slums of Mumbai, would play.  In preparation for reading this text, Mr. Dawson showed the students a map of India, pictures of Mumbai and a film clip about life in the Mumbai slums to activate and build prior knowledge to allow the students to better connect to the text.  Since the vocabulary was so challenging, Mr. Dawson assigned each student a difficult word from the text to look up.  That student then became an expert on that word and could contribute support for that word to the class during this lesson.  Students were asked to turn and talk with their partners about their predictions and then the students shared out.  Mr. Dawson then asked student to turn and talk and review the narrative techniques that they had been exploring in the unit.  The students were able to recall the three:  description, dialogue, and flash forward/back.  He then asked the students to discuss how these narrative techniques advance or develop a narrative.  After a brief review, Mr. Dawson assessed that the students had a good understanding of narrative techniques and their purpose.  He proceeded with the next part of the lesson by setting a purpose for the reading of the text.  He reminded students that they were to annotate their personal copies of the text using metacognitive markers. They were to look for narrative techniques and write a short summary of what was read.  Mr. Dawson wisely chose to provide scaffolding by using the strategy of shared reading because the text was so difficult.  This allowed the students to focus on the objective which was to explore the role of narrative techniques.  Mr. Dawson chunked the text, stopping after brief pieces to allow students to annotate.  When difficult vocabulary came up, he called upon the student experts to define the words.  He gave time for students to annotate and summarize, checking in before moving on.  During the read aloud, he would ask students clarifying questions to make sure that they had an understanding of the text.  ""Why do you think the police were coming for Abdul and his father?""  ""How does the description ""midnight was closing in"" work as a narrative technique?""  ""Why is Abdul the one who has to flee?  Why is he so important?""  How does Abdul's childhood negatively impact on his decision making?""  ""The author notes that other families resented the family due to ""economic envy.""  What does this reveal about the culture of the slums?""  These questions were written in the lesson plan and were carefully crafted to provide scaffolding and to facilitate student understanding.    At the end of the passage read, students were asked to stop and jot and predict what will happen next.  The lesson ended with a freewrite where students were asked to imagine living in Mumbai.  How would your childhood have been different?  What might have been the same?  This was designed to help students to connect to the text, build writing stamina, and allow for reflection on what was read.  The written plan was fully articulated and all elements were aligned with the stated objective.  Students were able to comprehend the passage, make connections, and identify narrative techniques and explain how those techniques contributed to the narrative.  The lesson was rigorous but enough scaffolding was provided to allow the students to be successful.   Students were intentionally partnered with a more advanced ENL partnered with a less advanced student.  In our post observation discussion, Mr Dawson showed me that he had annotated the text himself.  I suggested that he put his annotations up on the Smart Board to serve as a model for his students, which would given them even more scaffolding.  The lesson provided a variety of activities and strategies to support student learning including shared reading, use of technology, pictures, turn and talk, stop and jot, freewrites, using metacognitive markers, annotating text and summarizing.  Based on student responses and work, the objective was met.",Effective+,Effective+,Effective+,"Mr. Dawson excels in his area and is way beyond what I would expect for a first-year fellow.  He escorted students into the room and student monitors began distributing notebooks and texts.  The objective and do now were on the Smart Board and students began working on the do now without being told to do so.  There were clear time frames put on the Smart Board and the noise level for work was also indicated.  Accountable talk stems were clearly displayed on the wall.  The agenda for the period was also displayed on the whiteboard.  Mr. Dawson engaged with his students in a calm and friendly manner.  One young man tried to dominate the discussion and Mr. Dawson redirected the student's behavior without shutting him down.    ""Joseph, what an insightful comment.  Joseph has really given us something to think about.   How would you respond to Joseph's ideas?""    Mr. Dawson calmly and efficiently reinforced expectations for work and behavior.  "" I need you to turn around and focus on writing.  I need to see you pencil up.""  ""I don't want to have to separate you but it will be necessary if you distract one another.""  He consistently thanked students for doing the right thing.  He used a signal to get students together.  Students engaged with one another's ideas and behaved respectfully to one another and to the teacher.  They were collaborative and helpful to one another.  The students like being smart and love being challenged and feel comfortable with one another.  They are proud to have work that is difficult and the classroom culture can be described as perseverant and focused.  Mr. Dawson is calm and encouraging and gives students opportunities to engage in accountable talk and reflection.  Behavior is appropriate and students often monitor their own behavior.  Mr. Dawson is a calm but strong presence in the classroom without ever being confrontational.  As a result, the classroom environment reflects this and is calm and focused.  Technology is also employed effectively to provide clear expectations and time frames for work.",Effective,Effective+,Effective+,"The learning tasks and activities are fully aligned with the stated instructional objective.  Despite the extremely challenging text that the students were required to read, Mr. Dawson provided enough scaffolding and support to guide the students through the text effectively.  The lesson is well paced, and kept the students fully engaged.  I was particularly impressed with the exponential improvement in Mr. Dawson's questioning techniques.  His questions were well designed to provide excellent scaffolding, beginning with questions at the knowledge level to check for basic understanding, moving towards questions at the analysis, evaluation, and creation levels.  Questions facilitated excellent understanding and great discussion.    Students also asked their own questions which were referred to and entered into the discussion.  Students were provided with several opportunities to engage in accountable talk and reflection throughout the lesson.  (See examples of questions included in Domain 1.)",Effective+,"Mr. Dawson is highly self-reflective.  He is always looking at assessment data, considering the needs and strengths of his students when planning.  He was able to see the strengths and areas for improvement in his lesson.  Since the focus of this observation was on effective questioning, he spent a great deal of time thinking about the kinds of questions he would use to engage students in learning and facilitate their understanding.

The second class is a mixed a ability group.  Many of the students in the second class are low performing and/or have I.E.P's.    During our last observation, we discussed the need to differentiate instruction between the two classes.   One focus of this observation was to see how Ms. Gorevan adapted her planning and instruction to meet the needs of her students in both classes.  The second focus was to observe elements of domain 2, especially domains 2c and 2d.  Both classes are engaged in a study of Arthur Miller's The Crucible.   The instructional objective is:  SWBAT discover and analyze accusations in Act II of The Crucible.  In our post- observation conference, we discussed how instructional objectives should be transferable.  This objective wads only specific to this play.  We talked about rewording the objective so that it reflected the skills and learning that could be applied to other texts. We came up with:  Students will be able to analyze characters' motivations using textual evidence.  I saw differentiation between the two lessons.  During the first class, the lesson was developmental in its organization.  The learning came out of discussion.  Students were selected to read the parts from Act II.  Ms. Gorevan  posed excellent questions to facilitate student learning:  What is considered good proof?  What is factual evidence?  What does power do to the characters in the play?  What would motivate Tituba to confess?  What might she have done?   Students engaged in rich conversation, engaging directly with one another's ideas and citing textual evidence.  They also raised their own questions.  We discussed in our post-observation conference how it might have been beneficial to have the students rehearse or at least read the act being analyzed ahead of time in groups so that the reading was more fluent and expressive, and students would have already been familiar with the act.  During the second class, Ms. Gorevan provided a lot more scaffolding.  She altered the objective:  SWBAT analyze and discuss Tituba's confession.  Again, this objective is not transferrable.  The focus was really on character analysis and character motivation and the objective should reflect that focus.  The do now asked students to think about what is going to happen now that Tituba, Betty and Abigail have started accusing others of being witches.  After a brief share-out, Ms. Gorevan posed the question: What would you do if you were in Tituba's position knowing that you were threatened with punishment or death? She asked them how they would address Tituba's dilemma?  She explained the term dilemma and gave and example and then asked the students to give examples of dilemmas before moving on.  Students were given a worksheet.  The work sheet gave students space to think about possible courses of action that Tituba might have taken, the rationale for that action and pros and cons for each possible action.  While most students were able to complete the task, teacher modeling would have provided needed scaffolding for many of the students.  It is also important to remind students to cite textual evidence to support this course of action, although during the share out afterwards, students were able to cite this evidence from the text.  We also discussed in our post-observation conference how students might have benefitted from working in groups instead of independently on this task.  They would have had an opportunity to test their thinking out and consider other perspectives.  While this was done in the share out, cooperative work would have taken this further and deeper.  Overall, the students were able to meet the objective successfully in both classes.  We will work on incorporating more cooperative learning and consider using assessment to flexibly group students for such activities.",Effective,Developing+,Developing+,"I have observed some growth in this domain.  For the most part, students' behavior was appropriate in both sections I observed.  I noticed that there were fewer cell phones out.  Ms. Gorevan has been reinforcing the school system of having students place their cell phones in a pocket chart as they enter the room, only retrieving them at the end of the class.  I only observed one cell phone out and another student asked the other to put it away.  When two students were reluctant to check their phones, Ms. Gorevan insisted that they put them in the pocket chart.  Overall, students were respectful to both Ms. Gorevan and one another, although, at times, we discussed that students were a bit too familiar.  In our post-observation conference we discussed the importance of not taking things personally, and not being afraid that the students won't like her.  First, they need to respect her and themselves and the importance of the work they are doing.  We talked about the importance of taking a firmer tone and using firmer body language to convey expectations for work and behavior.  Instead of asking tentatively, ""Could you please take your seat?"" state firmly, ""I need you to take your seat now.""  We discussed that there is a difference between being firm and being confrontational.  Firm is proactive and calm and not personal.  Confrontational is reactive and can be personal.  I was pleased to see a system in place on Schedula that tracks points given or subtracted for class participation and behavior or lack thereof.  Students could monitor their own behavior when viewing Schedula.  I did see Ms. Gorevan reinforce expectations for behavior.  ""Please begin your do now.  You have five minutes to complete this task.  Please place your papers on the pile at the door and push your chairs in and clean up your area.  I was pleased to see that students also monitored their own behavior.  They reminded one another to wait their turns when speaking.   They also helped one another with pronunciation of words and offered assistance when some of their classmates were having difficulty.  The do now was on the board as students came in and they began work immediately.  Little time was lost to instruction.  Students were respectful to one another and engaged respectfully with one another's ideas using accountable talk stems.  ""I'd like to add on to what Max is saying.""  ""I don't really agree with what Jaydon was saying.  I don't see the evidence to support that.""   The students were focused on the play and enjoyed being engaged in discussion.  One student in the second class was particularly attention seeking in his behaviors  (getting out of his seat, calling out, being challenging:  ""I don't feel like doing that!"")  I pointed out to Ms. Gorevan in our post-observation conference that she called Robens' name 35 times in the course of trying to keep him on task.  We spoke about how this negative attention was still attention so this actually served as positive reinforcement for his attention seeking behavior.  We spoke of how this took time away from the rest of the class.  We talked about how to focus his attention seeking behavior, only giving him attention when doing the right thing or giving him attention in a constructive way before he asked for it.   Giving him a classroom responsibility and praising him for it, only paying him attention when he makes good behavior choices, rewarding others with attention who are doing the right thing, positive phone calls home,  and involving his parents and the dean, if necessary would all address his misbehavior.  Speaking to him privately rather than in front of the class would also give him attention without distracting from the others in the class.  Individual  contracts for work and behavior would also help.  Ms. Gorevan tried this when Robens tried to leave the room before the bell.  She asked him to please help her collect the papers and thanked him and he responded positively and complied.  I pointed out that when he was on task, that was when she should walk over and praise him specifically for that behavior.  We will continue to help Ms. Gorevan find the balance between forming positive relationships with her students and taking a firmer stance in expressing expectations for work and behavior.",Effective+,Effective,Developing+,"This is Ms. Gorevan's strongest area.  She acts excellent facilitating questions and engages her students in higher order thinking.  Students are engaged in the lesson and challenge one another's thinking comfortably.  Ms. Gorevan encourages students to take ownership for their learning.  Students ask and answer their own questions and engage in rich accountable talk using accountable talk stems.    The pacing of the lesson is good with the majority of the literacy block spent on student centered active learning.    The questions and activities were all aligned with the instructional outcomes and based on student responses, students demonstrated understanding fo the characters' motivations to make the choices they did. Ms. Gorevan is still developing in this area.  She uses questioning as her primary assessment tool.  She also uses student writing.  We will work on using data from a variety of assessment tools to group students and work towards tiering assignments, especially in her second class where the ability levels are so diverse.",Effective,"Ms. Gorevan is consistently reflective in her practices.  We did discuss that she tends to focus only on the grows in her planning and teaching, often losing sight of the glows.   She tends to be very hard on herself and sometimes the goals she sets for herself are unrealistic for a first- year teacher and cannot realistically be accomplished in the time frames she sets for herself.  During our post-observation conference, she did acknowledge that the level of discussion was at a high level.  Other strengths she identified were her questions, her students' use of accountable talk stems, and improvements in  the minimizing of in-class cell phone use.  She saw the need to form clearer objectives and recognized that she needed support in rewording them.  She also saw the need for more teacher modeling for her second period class and made adjustments to her lesson.",Average,

The lesson plan also included a topic, two objectives, an aim, ""Do Now"", mini lessons, teacher modeling, guided practice, independent practice, Pair/share group work, products of learning, and a summative assessment. The aim (How do we create our own business plan based on what we learned from our novel?) and two targeted objectives (SWAT identify the steps needed to create a business,SWAT cite evidence from the text to help create their own business plan.) helped clarify purpose and understanding of given tasks and matched instructional objectives.

Ms. Gallagher understands that questioning is the cornerstone of inquiry. The teacher asked many kinds of questions throughout this lesson challenging students to think critically and creatively. Once again probing questions helped students consider aspects of their own reading and past background knowledge. Open ended questions encouraged expression of different points of view leading to quality conversations and shared collaboration. Teacher created learning tasks are basically aligned with desired instructional outcomes. Flexible grouping and pair/share activities provided for student choice . Facing of the lesson was appropriate providing most students time for completion of the given task and a share out. Most importantly interactions between and among students provided opportunities for students to listen, confer, and work with peers who had similar interests and learning needs.

She also included a brief academic and behavioral description for each of her special needs students.  The lesson objective stated that students will be able to identify and state the functions of the parts of the lower gastrointestinal tract. This objective represents moderately high expectations for students, and provides ample opportunities to assess student learning.  The lesson activity asks students, in groups of four, to utilize both a life size model, as well as their textbook, to identify, label, and state the functions of all the parts of the lower GI tract on a worksheet they were given. The special needs students will receive a partially completed worksheet to assist them in the activity. This activity represents a moderate cognitive challenge to this group of 9th graders.",Effective,Effective+,Effective+,"Ms. Grinage and most of her students share a commitment to learning and working hard. A few of her students exhibit inconsistent effort, and required a significant degree of redirection. Most of Ms. Grinage's students understand their role as learners, and consistently expend an effort to learn.  Classroom routines and procedures effectively supported student learning. Minimal guidance was required for most students to follow established routines.   Although a few students required intermittent redirection and behavioral interventions, most behaviors were generally appropriate. Ms. Grinage's response to misbehavior was quick, purposeful and respectful.",Effective+,Effective+,Effective+,"Ms. Grinage incorporated multilevel questions to promote student thinking and understanding. Although very few students volunteered to respond to questions posed, Ms. Grinage cold called and redirected questions to a number of students during the lesson.  Most students were cognitively engaged throughout the lesson. Since this was an introductory lesson on the gastrointestinal tract, so students were mostly involved in the process of identifying the parts and functions of the various lower gastrointestinal organs. This process, without continued follow-up lessons later on, would be a low level cognitive experience, however, at this stage of the unit, it was appropriate. Ms. Grinage's ICT class contains many varied ability level students. Some of the most academically challenged students had a difficult time with the assignment and required much assistance.  Ms. Grinage assessed students throughout the lesson. During the mini-lesson, only a few students volunteered to answer questions, however, as mentioned, Ms. Grinage cold called students to increase student involvement and engagement. Ms. Grinage monitored students closely during the independent activity, which offered her ample assessment opportunities of student understanding and learning. Student worksheets were collected for grading at the end of the lesson.",Highly Effective,"Ms. Grinage was commended, during the post observation conference, for all of her efforts in teaching and managing an ICT biology class of 28 students alone, as her co-teacher was absent. Nevertheless, Ms. Grinage's lesson contained all of the elements of a developmental lesson. Students were largely engaged from bell to bell. They mostly worked in a respectful fashion with their classmates, and most of them were able to complete the learning activity. A number of Ms. Grinage's students are severely academically challenged and, since she was alone, she was unable to devote the extended time these students required to possess even a cursory understanding of the material.  I suggested that Ms. Grinage buddy her higher level students with one or two of her challenged students, particularly on days that her co-teacher is absent, to create a more supportive and beneficial learning experience for all of her students. Ms. Grinage must find ways to involve her lower functioning students in the lesson. Modified material and output expectations will allow them to access the curriculum more readily. As mentioned, teaming lower functioning students with higher functioning students will help them feel part of the lesson and build their self-esteem. She cold called, redirected and, at times, offered effective feedback. Ms. Grinage was praised for her efforts in attempting to include all students in the discussions.   Ms. Grinage's teaching instincts and traits are commendable. With experience, she will be one of those teachers who will be recognized for offering her students the best possible learning experience on a daily basis.",Average,
