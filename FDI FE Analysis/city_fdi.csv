She has many ideas for engaging students and setting up the classroom to have a more effective learning culture and environment, but she is somewhat powerless to make any decisions.

There is almost no culture of learning there, very few students showed respect to the teacher or to each other, and at any given moment only ¼ of the class was even trying to learn.

I saw some improvements since my first visit, and I can see that she is trying very hard to break through a very bad school culture and make a difference for her students.  Her potential is certainly being quashed at this school, and her principal is not even following the UFT teacher contract in designing her schedule, so I am very concerned about burn-out for her.",Average,

She does not have the far-reaching understanding of chemistry that will allow her to create well-scaffolded units of study as far as content; but her understanding of how to reach SPED students and all students at different levels is advanced for a first year teacher.  However, she is greatly limited by her co-teachers unwillingness to plan together and to design true co-teaching experiences that will increase learning outcomes for Ms. Ruiz's roster and for all the students in the class.  As such, most of what Ms. Ruiz can do ends up in-class attempts to guide the co-teacher into approaches that will create differentiated learning experiences.  Ms. Ruiz's ideas are excellent, and she is able to plan very effectively for her self-contained science classes, but in this class she is forced to bandaid the problems because of the unwillingness of her co-teacher to follow the true purpose of co-teaching in an ICT classroom.",Developing+,Effective,Effective,"In this area, Ms. Ruiz and her co-teacher could be excellent complements to each other, as their styles are very different and could work well together to reach different students.  However, again, her co-teacher is unwilling to follow any actual co-teaching model, does not plan with Ms. Ruiz and uses her mostly as a teaching assistant.  Students are very well-behaved, and actually it was remarkable to see students in this class with a completely opposite level of focus and engagement than I saw them having in a math class earlier that day with a different teacher.  But the co-teacher rules with the power of her personality and often makes cutting comments to students.  Ms. Ruiz's approach is much more student-centered, and she works to nurture students and bring out their natural desire to learn, but it is very difficult to build that classroom culture because she is being used as an assistant and not as a teacher.",Developing+,Developing+,Developing,"Again, in this area, Ms. Ruiz had a lot of excellent ideas, and I saw in the classroom that she tried to provide students with opportunities for deeper thinking, and that she noticed when students were not understanding concepts fully or needed more help, while her co-teacher moved on rapidly and did not notice.  In our post-ob, she shared with me ideas she had for differentiating the lesson, for increasing student engagement, but she was not able to put these into practice.  One student who had been a terror in the math class I observed earlier told me, when I asked her why she was so different in this class, that it was because of Ms. Ruiz, and I observed how Ms. Ruiz worked with this student very effectively and understood that this student needed to an LD assessment.  Ms. Ruiz also stopped the co-teacher several times to ask questions – in so doing, she modeled good questioning and deeper critical thinking and showed how she was able to gauge what students were struggling with – each time she asked those questions, she enabled a slow-down of the lesson, an attention to a skill that the students needed help with.  The echoes in the classroom were evidence that each time she did that, she was correct in understanding what the student's needed; and she was in her method making the best use of an ineffective co-teaching set-up.",Effective,"Ms. Ruiz is extremely reflective of her practice.  She is able to try out many of her ideas for honing her skills in her self-contained classroom and is very frustrated by her inability to do so in the other classrooms but is making the best of the situation.  She is so passionate and confident in her teaching ability that she may at times be more ready to share her ideas than to hear a new one, but given the virtual stranglehold on her in this set-up, and the total lack of support she receives from school administration – as well as the contract violations she is dealing with in terms of too many preps and not enough planning time, it is completely understandable that she is dying to share ideas for great teaching.",Above Average,

(see last bullet under comments for 2b, 2c and 2d.) •	The Learning Objectives were measurable but should be written in student friendly language using 'I Can' statements. 'I Can' statements empower students, provide a common focus, communicate what is important, build community and engagement and increase motivation and confidence.- Brian Shepard •	The Learning Objectives were too ambitious. •	The lesson was standards-based. Please write out the entire standard. •	There was no evidence of differentiation for groups of students. •	Physical environment must be conducive for students to work in groups. A case in point is the arrangement of the seats for discussion purposes, as we discussed. •	When assigning a text to read or watching a video, the teacher should pose a question the students should listen for in order to give the video a purpose. This would give the students an idea before they watch what to expect, what to look for and what might be worth thinking about. In the case of this text, the students could have been asked to think about how their assigned text impacted the American economy.  •	As students worked in the table groups, the teacher could have worked with one of the groups. •	While sitting in groups, the teacher should have had the students arrange their desks so they could participate more in a conversation.  •	There was some disagreement about the rating of the causes. Had the students been sitting in a circle or facing each other as the other groups were, they could have had a discussion and come to a consensus while the teacher facilitated.",Developing+,Developing+,Effective,"•	Transitions were smooth  •	Behavior was appropriate.  •	Students were well-behaved, motivated to take part in the lesson; yet teacher seems to exhibit a lack of presence. Students don't see the teacher as an equal as demonstrated when a student asked the co-teacher for his rankings of the causes.",Developing,Effective,Developing,"•	As the teacher elaborated, he could have asked thought provoking questions. An example could have been when Justin spoke about his grandfather's investment and the teacher mentioned that during the Great Depression was kind of like the opposite. This could have been presented to the students for discussion.  •	While the co-teacher facilitated the mini-lesson, the teacher elaborated and added information.  •	Keep class focused by staying a way from tangents and little jokes and stories. •	A final assessment question, related to the Learning Objectives, should have been asked at the end of the period. The students could have discussed it in their groups, followed by a share. After each group shared their priorities, the teacher could have asked what conclusions they can drw from the fact that different groups had different priority orders.",Developing,,Below Average,

So much time is spent on this, in fact, that once students are actually able to settle down to read content or to use it to fill out the ""note catchers,"" they are extremely rushed and have very little time to think deeply.  I observed many conversations spring out of the reading that showed deep interest and which were at a much higher order of thinking, but which were quashed by the co-teacher because students were not focusing on the lower-order questions on the notecatcher.

Mr. Acree had worked hard to find a story at his students' reading level but had not considered the need for a higher interest content that would engage them more deeply, or for tasks that would do so.

So she taught this concept quickly without realizing that could not apply the rule because they didn't understand the terms fully.  The lesson had some practice and discussion of the practice but the rest of the lesson involved students working alone on a worksheet.
