Students were not assigned a Do Now or entry activity. This led to a loss of approximately 10 minutes at the beginning of the lesson due to students settling down. Additionally, the learning objective was not introduced. Students were just told to begin reading aloud from where they left off in the previous lesson.

Only 3 out of 8 students were on-task for most of the period. The other 5 students exhibited varied levels of engagement and off-task behaviors. Pacing was adequate, however, negative behaviors and off-task talking were tolerated, which disrupted the coherency of the lesson.

We discussed, again, that the start of the lesson was very poor, as 10 minutes of instructional time was lost due to poor planning and a lack of a Do Now routine, which has been noted and discussed, in all previous observations. Ms. Caramanica readily recognized the poor start.   Another area that requires immediate attention is to add more inclusive and balanced questioning utilizing the redirection process. Improvement in this area will increase student participation and yield more cognitive engagement.  The overall classroom culture has improved, but hard work and a commitment to learning by students are still very inconsistent. Ms. Caramanica must be more demanding and express higher expectations to her students. Additionally, the use of positive praise and effective feedback, when utilized consistently, will help to build student esteem, as well as offer students an honest assessment of their learning efforts.   Ms. Caramanica's lesson plan was detailed and developed, however, her lesson delivery requires a lot of work.
