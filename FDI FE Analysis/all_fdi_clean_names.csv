She does not have the far-reaching understanding of chemistry that will allow her to create well-scaffolded units of study as far as content; but her understanding of how to reach SPED students and all students at different levels is advanced for a first year teacher.  However, she is greatly limited by her co-teachers unwillingness to plan together and to design true co-teaching experiences that will increase learning outcomes for Ms. Ruiz's roster and for all the students in the class.  As such, most of what Ms. Ruiz can do ends up in-class attempts to guide the co-teacher into approaches that will create differentiated learning experiences.  Ms. Ruiz's ideas are excellent, and she is able to plan very effectively for her self-contained science classes, but in this class she is forced to bandaid the problems because of the unwillingness of her co-teacher to follow the true purpose of co-teaching in an ICT classroom.",Developing+,Effective,Effective,"In this area, Ms. Ruiz and her co-teacher could be excellent complements to each other, as their styles are very different and could work well together to reach different students.  However, again, her co-teacher is unwilling to follow any actual co-teaching model, does not plan with Ms. Ruiz and uses her mostly as a teaching assistant.  Students are very well-behaved, and actually it was remarkable to see students in this class with a completely opposite level of focus and engagement than I saw them having in a math class earlier that day with a different teacher.  But the co-teacher rules with the power of her personality and often makes cutting comments to students.  Ms. Ruiz's approach is much more student-centered, and she works to nurture students and bring out their natural desire to learn, but it is very difficult to build that classroom culture because she is being used as an assistant and not as a teacher.",Developing+,Developing+,Developing,"Again, in this area, Ms. Ruiz had a lot of excellent ideas, and I saw in the classroom that she tried to provide students with opportunities for deeper thinking, and that she noticed when students were not understanding concepts fully or needed more help, while her co-teacher moved on rapidly and did not notice.  In our post-ob, she shared with me ideas she had for differentiating the lesson, for increasing student engagement, but she was not able to put these into practice.  One student who had been a terror in the math class I observed earlier told me, when I asked her why she was so different in this class, that it was because of Ms. Ruiz, and I observed how Ms. Ruiz worked with this student very effectively and understood that this student needed to an LD assessment.  Ms. Ruiz also stopped the co-teacher several times to ask questions – in so doing, she modeled good questioning and deeper critical thinking and showed how she was able to gauge what students were struggling with – each time she asked those questions, she enabled a slow-down of the lesson, an attention to a skill that the students needed help with.  The echoes in the classroom were evidence that each time she did that, she was correct in understanding what the student's needed; and she was in her method making the best use of an ineffective co-teaching set-up.",Effective,"Ms. Ruiz is extremely reflective of her practice.  She is able to try out many of her ideas for honing her skills in her self-contained classroom and is very frustrated by her inability to do so in the other classrooms but is making the best of the situation.  She is so passionate and confident in her teaching ability that she may at times be more ready to share her ideas than to hear a new one, but given the virtual stranglehold on her in this set-up, and the total lack of support she receives from school administration – as well as the contract violations she is dealing with in terms of too many preps and not enough planning time, it is completely understandable that she is dying to share ideas for great teaching.",Above Average,City,02M529,4db41c5b-4111-48f4-b0e3-a5b400df4dfb

This seemed to be more a result of poor support from her department, as Ms. Smith was very eager to find a solution and to create meaningful lessons.  The lesson structure itself did not make use of positive interdependence or clearly define how much students had to accomplish during the period, or how they would be assessed.

However, the lesson itself had very little structure to it, and no accountability for students.  They had a worksheet to fill out but he had not planned for how to translate that work into a coherent discussions, and students did not understand how they would be assessed, or for what.",Ineffective,Ineffective,Developing,"Many teachers in better circumstances appear to be overwhelmed, disgruntled, annoyed.  But Mr. Billson in a very chaotic classroom environment continued to be cheerful and happy to see and work with his students.   That will serve him sell as he hones his other teaching skills.  But the learning environment for this lesson was disastrous.  Students were extremely rude to him and to each other.  One group of students chatted, played on their phones and ate a full meal during the lesson, almost never participating.  One small group of students did participate, but inconsistently, clearly aware that there were no consequences for not participating and no reward for participating.  There was no clear outcome nor a clear end assessment or connection to homework.  Mr. Billson mentioned that his co-teacher does not plan with him or give him an opportunity to truly co-teach; the absence of the co-teacher did not change the problem, that Mr. Billson had not been able to create a learning environment through a strong lesson plan or established procedures.",Developing,Developing,Ineffective,"Again, Mr. Billson had made an effort to find an interesting reading for students to do when the co-teacher did not show up and had not left a lesson.  And he had a good idea for how students could relate the despotic leader in the reading to studies of other despotic leaders.  But there student engagement was extremely inconsistent and not purposeful, there was little opportunity for solid discussion, including questioning, and while he did not have wild behavior in the room, nor did he have focus or respect from students.  Even a purposeful arrangement of the chairs in the room, with students sitting together for discussion and with the chatty students separated, would have made a huge difference.",Developing,"Mr. Billson is in the very early stages of being able to reflect on the lesson.
