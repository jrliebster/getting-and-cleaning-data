Unfortunately the onsite coach who has been assigned to support him has provided support in planning, instruction and environment.  However, on the three occasions that she was to view ( with administration) to provide informal feedback to support his professional growth, he called out.  Additionally he has been provided the opportunity to visit classrooms to view various components of Literacy instruction (Centers, Guided Reading ), however he has been unable to demonstrate that he is able to implement what he is learning within his own classroom.    Teaching Fellows need to have greater exposure to the reality of being in a school in addition to the theory behind what occurs.
