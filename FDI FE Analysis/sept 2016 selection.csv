I had spent two years abroad teaching, and while this had shown me how to run a basic ESL class, I still had no idea why I wanted to teach or who I wanted to teach. I didn't even know which country I wanted to live in. Now I have invested 3 years in ESL teaching in American cities. I moved to New York largely with the idea of teaching ESL to underprivileged foreign communities, for whom I felt it could be of more instantly practical benefit. My experiences with this have not disappointed; in fact they have given me a desire to connect to this city and its inhabitants through teaching. 
My desire and sense of purpose have become much clearer and stronger. I have also gained a lot of experience teaching. I am still at the beginning of my career, but since coming back to America 3 years ago, I have taught at 5 different schools. All of these schools expected teachers to be inspiring enough to retain students, who paid weekly or monthly. I feel that this has taught me to always provide a valuable teaching product, and molded me firmly in the student-centered class model. I have always had to balance fun and constructive learning, and if my students didn't like it, they could quit, but they never did. 
Middle and high school classes can be dreary, intimidating places. ESL students in particular can feel judged for their abilities and sometimes respond by resisting all forms of education. I have consistently proven that I can create fun, nurturing atmospheres where students are happy and eager to contribute. I have also consistently proven that I can help students evolve their language quickly and naturally.

Fellow has been told that she needs to report to work tomorrow.


Just got off the phone with Tristin. She actually reached out to me, stating exactly what you’ve captured Sarah and that the Principal is planning on firing Tenika this week for job abandonment. 

So, Tristin feels incredibly bad about the situation and wants to know if there is something she should write to the HRD or Principal apologizing for the language used in her email. Also, it’s quite possible there was miscommunication around who would be reaching out to the Principal. Below, I’ve captured the communication trail between Heather and I regarding her placement. I will reach out to Heather to see when she last spoke to Tenika. 

Best,
Charlene

Hey Charlene,

Happy New Year to you!

We’ve reached out to her, but have not heard back. I actually called her this morning, but her voicemail is full so I sent her an email asking her to call the office.

If the university does not approve of this position, she needs to inform the principal of this, and we can provide her with some talking points to share with the principal. Generally, this is sufficient in being released from the position. If the principal will still not release her, Tenika can reach back out to us and we will be able to follow up with the principal.

Best,
Heather

Hi Heather, 

Happy New Year! I hope you were able to enjoy the holidays with family and friends!

I just wanted to reach out to follow-up about Tenika. Due to the placement being outside of an ICT setting, CCNY will not support it. She appears to be bound to a position at 10X080, although approval wasn’t given. Were you ever able to speak to Tenika? 

Thanks,

Hey Heather, feel free to reach out to her. I’m pretty sure if I told Tristin that Tenika needed to move forward with the position, Trisitn would probably not approve it due to the setting being outside of an ICT.

Hi Charlene,

Thank you for sending these along!

Is Tenika’s position approved by the university? I ask because if the position is approved, we expect that Fellows follow through with the hiring commitments that they have made. Do you have any additional information regarding Tenika’s  situation? It might be worth it for our office to reach out to her. 

Best,
Heather

Hey Heather, 

Here’s what I have so far for the Problem commitment grid.  

Quick question: Considering that Tenika Isaacs no longer wants to accept the position at 10X080, is there a process that she must go through to be released from the nomination? You’ll see in my notes that she spoke to CCNY about the position and stated she no longer wants the position, plus it was a self-contained room. Should she just communicate that to the Principal?

Thanks!

Charlene

FYI – I left a message for Debra and emailed her.

Marie was talking to the Fellow when I walked in there. Fellow is very confused about who is whom here and at City. I don’t have a whole lot to share from that conversation except she thought that Tristin would be reaching out to the principal about this. The principal is trying to get her fired for job abandonment.

Hello Ms. Crawford,

Thank you for taking the time out to help me with this matter. I hope the information below is sufficient.  Once again I will explain the timeline of events. I accepted the position within MS080 on 12/1/16.  I uploaded my hiring commitment form and then received a call from the Fellows program stating I must contact the program Director for CCNY Tristin Wildstien. I left numerous voicemail and emails for her and was unable to get a response then I received an email on 12/8/16 stating that I cannot work outside of an ICT or SETTS setting and that I should avoid the very school I accepted  a position in. I responded directly to Tristin's email requesting the ability to speak to her. I spoke to her the next day and she stated that I could not accept the position at MS080 and that she would respond to an email sent her by the program stating that she would not honor the position and that the program would contact Mr. Polanco. Upon my job search I was offered position within 2 QUEENS schools, MAST HS and August Martin HS. The principal of MAST advised me that I was still attached to the roster of MS080. I then contacted the program and Ms. Wildstien again. Ms. Wildstien stated that it was my responsibility to contact Mr. Polanco and I did at that time. I have contacted Mr. Polanco numerous times via email and telephone and have not received a response. Ms Rory Parnell of August Martin has contacted him as well. Mr. Polanco has not responded to any correspondence at this time. I really hop you can help with this matter. Attached you will find my hiring commitment form I signed with MS080 and below you will find all email correspondence between Ms. Wildstien and myself regarding this matter as well as the emails I have sent to Mr. Polanco.

Good Morning Mr. Polanco, 

                                   I hope this correspondence finds you in the best of spirits. I reached out to you in December via telephone and then again in the beginning of this month via email in regards to my inability to accept your previous offer to sign on with MS080. As you know, I was extremely excited for the opportunity to on board with your team; however, I am bound by the rules of the New York City Teaching Fellows and must abide by them. I apologize for the inconvenience; but I am asking that you please remove me from your roster so that I may accept another appointment that meets the programs requirements.  I have attached the principal of the current school I would like to join, she has been attempting to call you as well. Please contact her or myself at your earliest convenience in regards to this matter. Also, I will attempt to reach out to you via phone again.

Good Afternoon Mr. Polanco, 

I apologize for not reaching out to you sooner. I was advised by the teaching fellows not to. Upon processing my hiring commitment form a fellow from the NYCTF flagged my potential teaching position as non supportable I was then advised to contact Ms. Tristan Wildstein the program director of the NYCTF. Ms. Tristan Wildstein who reiterated what was told to me by the Central Office also said that I should begin looking at other options and not to reach out to you as the Fellows would handle that matter. Needless to say, I am now reaching out to you hoping that you will remove me from your roster. At this time I have found employment elsewhere in a position that meets the program standards however, as I stated before I am still attached to your roster. I apologize for the inconvenience and really would have loved to partake in the opportunity I was being offered at MS 080 however, I must decline and respectfully ask to be removed from your roster as the program will not support me working at your school at this time. At this time I cannot afford to forfeit my licencing program and must abide by their rules. I apologize for any inconveniences and can provide any and all information necessary in regards to this issue. I apologize that you were not contacted sooner.I called you today to explain verbally and left a voicemail on your secretaries phone. 

Please contact me at your earliest convenience.

Dear fellows,

This email is to remind you that you may take jobs in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn. You may not accept jobs in Staten Island. Additionally, you may not take jobs further east than St. Johns University of JFK airport. Our field consultants have a contractual agreement to visit you once per month in the field and are not able to travel beyond the aforementioned locations.

As a reminder, if you’re SPED, you should be looking in 7-12 in ICT or SETTS positions ONLY. 12:1:1 is not OK. Self-contained content area settings are not OK.

If you’re TESOL, you may only be teaching in pull-out ENL or push-in ENL settings (integrated ENL with a coteacher). You may not be teaching a self-contained generalist or content-area position.

Please email me your test scores and your school name/address when you accept a position.

Best,

Dear fellows,

This email is a reminder that you may only take jobs working in ICT and SETTS settings. You may not teach in self-contained classrooms.  Our unhappiest SPED fellows are working in self-contained classrooms. Also, as a hint, we have heard fellows should avoid jobs at 10X080, 04M072, or in any school in District 12.  Once you do accept a job, email me the name and address of the school.

Also, about 6 of you haven’t registered for next semester. If you have an ADV hold on your account, please email confirmation of your GRE registration/completion to edgradadm@ccny.cuny.edu, along with your EMPLID and first and last name and a request to remove the hold. You will not be able to register until to you do this. If you register too late, you WILL incur a late registration fee (the NYCTF will not pay for this fee). You must register before classes begin.

Further, you should all be emailing me copies of your passing EAS, ALST, CST scores. We have recommended you all in TEACH for your Trans B (unless you haven’t completed DASA). Your Trans B will not be approved until TEACH sees that you’ve passed your EAS, ALST, and all parts of the CST. If you have passed all of these tests and they are showing up in TEACH AND you’ve completed DASA, your Trans B should show up. If it doesn’t, please call TEACH at 518-486-6041.

If you haven’t completed DASA, you have until you begin teaching or until the beginning of next semester to complete it. If you do not complete DASA, the NYCTF will dismiss you. We will be offering a DASA workshop on January 26 (I don’t have the time yet of it). Stay tuned for more information. 

Let me know if you have questions.

Best,

Dear Ms. Tong,
Pace University was just notified that your GRE scores for the November 26, 2016 test administration were invalid. Your scores were, therefore, canceled.
Based on this information, Pace must rescind your admission to the University effective immediately.  You will not be allowed to register for any additional courses which means you can no longer continue in the Teaching Fellows Program - Cohort Mid Yr. 2017.

I went to selection day and did an online exam. I was disappointed when I did not get selected. 
       A few weeks ago, I was looking online for a bilingual Spanish job and a message about this NYC teaching fellowship came up on the screen. At first I was not sure if I was eligible to apply again, but when I found I could, I was determined to apply and do my best. 
       I found that my experience with the selection day process was a very good one. The leaders of the group and the other applicants were all very nice. Before I went to the school that day, I thought I would be the oldest person there. To my surprise, the majority of the people were at least thirty and a few were older than I am. It was an interesting evening. While I am used to being in front of students, I was a little apprehensive teaching a group of strangers. The leaders were many years younger than I, but they made our experience relaxed and rewarding. That night convinced me that the NYC fellowship program was for me. I feel very strongly that this program will help me become an effective educator who can help children achieve their potential.
",6/15/1999,no,,,,,,no,Accept,Accept,English as a Second Language,3/4/1963,5/23/2016,Recommend with Confidence,,Email from Helen to Chris Diaz,"Received this e-mail from Helen after her 3rd observation:

Good evening Chris,
I am writing to you because I am very concerned about my recent observation and the emails that I received today. I know that Lamar spoke to you about the observation, and I also mentioned it to Najah yesterday. 
In my second observation I received a two for classroom culture and then out of the blue Priyanka showed up again and gave me a Pip. I was under the impression that I would only get a Pip if I got below a two on my observation.

Last Thursday I had my third observation with Marcy. She gave me a two in all sections. I was extremely unhappy with this for many reasons. First of all she came on a day that Lamar was not in school even though we had advised her that he was not going to be in that day. We asked for a different day and she insisted on coming that day. So I don't even have his proof of how the observation went. 
The next point that I need to make is that she told Lamar that I did not follow the plan, yet failed to observe that we were in our second class with the 804 students that day. I was following the plan and I covered everything. Yes, I now know that students were doing things behind my back but that is what kids do, especially when their own teacher is not there. Marcy's scores do not reflect any improvement on my part, in fact they make it look as though I did not even try to improve.
Now to the emails that I received today. The tone of the emails is very upsetting, I feel as though I am being reprimanded for getting a Pip. What is even more discouraging is that apparently I will have to take that issue up with a prospective principal in a job interview. That, to me is a mark on my character. I was accepted into this program without a blemish on my character and now this will have a negative effect on any interview that I might get.  I have followed all the instructions and I have worked hard at my teacher training, and I have been professional at all times.

Can you please help me to have my scores changed so that I may have the same chances as my fellow Fellows in getting accepted into the program and in looking for a job? 
I await your reply,
Helen Kneeshaw

Hi Chris, I got your name from Lamar. I am a teaching fellow at Middle school 226 with Lamar Timmons. 
When I left school this afternoon, I was on my way to my car and I had a very bad fall on the sidewalk. 
I couldn't go to my fellowship training in the city, I had to come home. 
I just got back from the urgent care. I have a badly sprained left ankle  and a bad cut and swelling of my right elbow. 
I am extremely concerned about missing school and college tomorrow. I have to go to City College at night. 
What should I do because I don't want to jeopardize my fellowship?

After speaking with the student Ms. Sica was able to determine that the student asked him for his telephone number to be able to see how he was doing.

Special education?  Speech and language pathology, or occupational therapy?  It wasn’t until I had spent time in all the different classrooms Weston has offered me, working with so many different ages, grades, diagnoses, and backgrounds, that I was sure this was the direction I needed to take.  After a few long talks about a student with the psychologist at our school, I was inspired to take another psychology class at our local community college.  I decided to try and learn sign language after it was being introduced by a speech pathologist in one of our classrooms.  Most importantly, I love watching my fellow teachers at work, and I want to contribute to this great profession.  And while I’ve certainly been made to feel like a valuable member of my school, I know there is still so much I can learn to become a more effective teacher.  What’s more, a masters degree would pull me out of the typical one-to-one style case management for a paraprofessional and offer me the opportunity to help more students as a teacher.  Coincidentally, I recently met a graduate of NYCTF, Sarah Gotimer, a friend of a French teacher with whom I used to work, and she had nothing but positive stories to share (including that she still works at her original school after 5 years!).  And while NYCTF is not the only program to obtain a degree in education, the recommendations from Sarah as well as the testimonials of so many others make NYCTF stand out far beyond the others.",5/16/2010,no,,,,,,no,Accept,Accept,Special Education - Elementary,9/24/1988,5/26/2016,Recommend with Reservations,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I told her to provide me with their names via email, and below is what she sent.  

For Yan Carlos, he is unable to register until he registers for the GRE because he has already had 1 semester as a non-matriculated student, and CCNY will not allow him to move forward as a non-matric student for a 2nd semester. He should reach out to Tristin for guidance and apply for the GRE as soon as possible.

I found out after submitting my application that I could not make or receive international phone calls. I scheduled two phone interviews, each time thinking I had found ways to receive calls from the United States, but neither of the calls worked. Because of this, I sent an email asking that my application be removed from consideration. I thought I would have to wait until January of 2017 to apply again, so I was excited to see that there is a Fall Cohort this year and that you are accepting Fellows to teach Special Education. Elementary Special Education remains my first choice. I am back in the United States now, and if I am offered the chance to participate in a phone interview again, I will definitely be able to receive the call. 

I also want to indicate that although teaching students with special needs is my first subject area preference, I am also very interested in teaching ESL, and will gladly train to teach ESL if that is where I am needed.

I am following up regarding the OEO investigation that I am a party to. Since receiving new of the investigation in early December, I have not heard anything from their office. In order to update my contact information with my new NYC mailing address, I called Chanel at their office (718-935-2181).

In her attempt to update my address in their files she noticed that I did not have a file; there is not yet any record of any investigation in which I am involved. Chanel informed me that it typically takes less than a month to initiate the file for preliminary processing (creation of a file). Chanel said she was not sure why a file has not been created for me and did not have any information about the situation. To her knowledge, the OEO has not initiated any proceedings. It has now been two months since the initial notification I received.

I am hoping to gain clarity on the status of the situation. I have been out of work for two months, despite receiving an offer for a position that urgently needed to be promptly filled at MS 31, and would very much appreciate the proceedings at least being initiated. Since the OEO has no information on the investigation, I am hoping that the Teaching Fellows office can reach out to the OEO internally to clarify when the investigation will initiate with creation of a file.

It is important that I understand when the investigation will commence so I can plan the next two or three months of my life.

Thank you for your help in this process,

Casey Penk""",None,Casey arrived at the office,"Casey Penk arrived at the office this afternoon, looking for more information about his OEO status. I spoke with him (Carly and Lizette were with me) and told him that he should wait to be contacted by OEO, that OEO would be involving him in the investigation, and that there was nothing more we could do or tell him at this time. ",None,Call with Casey,"At his principal's direction, Casey called me this afternoon. I asked Casey if he had received the letter from our office stating that his case was under review. He said he had, and didn’t realize he wasn’t supposed to be reporting to school. I made clear, several times, that he should not report to school until his case had been investigated by OEO. He said he understood. His questions were about the timeline for investigation. He then said “Investigation is extremely inscrutable to me. I am involved in the process? Impression I get is that I don't get to be involved. This is a decision about my employment status and it's very important to me that I have the ability to provide input whether that's document or a statement. In any disciplinary matter, I tend to believe that's how it's conducted with a fair manner.” He then asked for contact info for OEO. I said I didn’t have any, but would look into it for him. I told him to await word from either our office or OEO before returning to a school site. He said he understood and would do just that. 
",None,Call with principal,"Principal Call
I spoke with Principal Hewlett this afternoon regarding Casey's status in the program. I informed the principal that Casey should not be reporting to work until he has been notified by our office that he has been cleared. I did not mention the OEO investigation, as per our legal counsel’s instruction. The principal said he understood, but that Casey had reported to the school on 12/5 and 12/6. He said he’d have Casey call me right away.

Subject: New Teaching Position

 
Hello Ms. Aguilar,

I hope you are doing well and enjoyed your Thanksgiving. I am writing with regards to the notification I received today that my status in Teaching Fellows is pending a review by the NYC OEO. I have discussed this matter with Mrs. Ackert and believe she is contacting you as well.

I would like to first extend my deepest apologies for any comments I made that were perceived as biased, prejudiced, or unfair. I have never intended to engage in language that is offensive based on race or any other characteristic. I realize that discussions about these topics—particularly during this contentious election season—can often be fraught and I apologize if something I said caused unnecessary tension. It was not my goal and does not reflect my deeply-held belief in the equality of all people. I reject the divisive rhetoric and beliefs that have been so widespread during this election and made a point to repeatedly emphasize the value of inclusion, diversity, and tolerance to my students at Inwood 52. I will continue to expand my understanding of race-related topics in order to reduce any latent bias I have and ensure I engage in these matters professionally, respectfully, and sensitively.

My goal has always been to further interracial understanding and cooperation. I care about our students and colleagues from all racial, ethnic, and national backgrounds and will do my best to demonstrate that in my work.

I would appreciate your input on how I should proceed with my new job. My new school has had a vacancy for their 6th grade ICT position since September, which has meant that students have gone without a second teacher and have thus lacked individualized attention and mentoring. This is particularly unacceptable for the students with special needs, who legally and ethically deserve a teacher who can provide high-quality, differentiated instruction. My goal is to provide that as soon as possible. My new school has already nominated me for this position and I have completed the requisite verification with DoE HR; I am fully prepared to step into this role.

I am more than happy to proceed with this position while the review is underway, of course with the understanding that we will have to assess the results of the review at that future date (be it a few days or a few weeks from now). My interest is in serving these students any way that I can. I very much hope to do so.

Please let me know how you expect I proceed at your earliest convenience.

Thank you,
Casey Penk

Subject: Attendance for two Fellows

Hi Katie, 

Hope all’s going well in SBS today! 

I wanted to follow up on two Fellows in your SBS group who reached out to you and/or our front office about attendance issues. 

1. Hadiyah Najeeullah – who notified us of having to come into SBS late on 8/31 and will miss one hour of SBS. Please mark her as absent for 8/31 – we have logged her reason and will take that into consideration. But for now, this will count as a personal day – of which she has 3 total. 

2. Magala Bien-Alme – who notified us that she will need to leave SBS today, 8/30, at 2:00pm for a court appointment. She should also be marked as absent as she will be missing a full SBS. 

Let me know if you have any questions about this - I’ll also be around SJU today (in a red dress) if you have any concerns. 

Best, 
Dana

She was able to clarify that he had applied for a leave of absence in the summer but pulled the application, and then submitted his resignation letter in December for a retroactive resignation effective 9/6/16. He had previously been put on an unauthorized leave because he had not communicated clearly to his school and was MIA throughout the fall until the school received his resignation letter in December. 

Actions were taken today to update his service history to reflect a resignation (DQT) effective 9/6/16, which was reversed back to a leaves status at my request because of the earlier hire situation noted in previous Issue Logs. I'm also including the email thread re: his service history status below.

He’s now asking for a transfer to a different school closer to home. 

If 6/28/16 is his resignation date, then he may owe money at this point. It looks like absences were entered until 11/30/16 some checks were issued while he was MIA. He may be receiving paper checks. Can we confirm that he hasn’t received these checks?

Good afternoon Bermet,

I have attached 11 resumes of candidates in the New Teacher Finder.

These candidates meet the following criteria:
1) Have applied since December 5, 2016
2) Are certified
3) Indicated a preference for a position in Queens
4) Marked that they available to interview immediately. 

We recommend that principals send one email explaining the position and BCC all candidates, asking them to respond if they are interested. This is typically the fastest way to begin setting up interviews.

I hope that one of these candidates will be a match. If not, please let me know, and I can cast a wider net in NTF.

Thank you,

Hello Heather, 

Thanks for the link. I shared it with the principal but I am sure that he already has the resumes of this candidates since I shared the Teaching fellows resume book back in December. I expected a more personalized approach with the recommendation from your office. 

Nuree, 

I need a resume book of the NEW candidates from the New Teacher Finder. Please share with me a resume book if you have one available at this time or provide a list of this year’s (2017) prescreened certified candidates. I can pull up the list of the Common Branch candidates from the NTF myself but I need only this year’s applicants so that my principal is not reaching out to someone who maybe no longer interested.  The sooner Dr. K Tori selects a new candidate the sooner we can find a resolution for Mr. Timmons. 

Best, 
Bermet

Hi Bermet,
 
I’m cc-ing the Fellows team overseeing the Hire Fellows inbox and Heather can send over the resume book of any available SPED 1-6 Fellows. I’m also cc-ing the Hiring Support team to see if there are any viable SPED 1-6 teachers available in the NTF right now. The NTF should also have other subject teachers ready, if this is a GenEd 1-6 vacancy. 
 
Based on what you are stating in your email, it sounds like Principal Ktori is only willing to cancel the nomination once he has a viable candidate to take over Curtis Timmons’ position – is this assumption correct? 
 
Thanks,
Nuree

Hi Nuree, 
 
You are not the only one who feels this way in this situation, I recommended the Teaching Fellows to this school. I understand your desire to help this Fellow however, you also need to consider the needs to the students in the NYC DOE schools. Dr. K Tori and most importantly his students are in a need of a teacher at this moment. I am suggesting for the Teaching Fellows or the TRQ office to provide a viable list of the candidates who are available for the hire at this moment to alleviate the situation and assist the school and the kids who are being affected. I tried to reach you and the Fellows office but no one is picking up the phone. We need to figure out how to assist the school to staff the vacancy which in turn will help your Fellow as well. So please give me a call when you are available to discuss further. 
 
Thanks, 
Bermet

Hi Bermet, 
 
Thanks for your response. I’m feeling stuck here because I’m not sure what Principal Ktori wants to achieve here by not cancelling the nomination that hasn’t even finalized and to wait for the Fellow to resign. There’s no resignation to be had because he hasn’t finalized on payroll. Yes, Curtis Timmons has accepted the job offer but he started working without finalizing onto payroll, and hasn’t yet finalized. Additionally, I am told that the Fellow reached out to Principal Ktori about being released from 29Q015 because of his responsibility to take care of his sick mother and his desire to be at another location closer to her to do so. 
 
Also, because Chanette Shaw (former HRD and colleague who works closely with HRDs re: ATRs) is at TRQ, I’ve also spoken with her for some insight on figuring this out/next steps I can take, and she has offered to reach out to Principal Ktori.  
 
Best,
Nuree

Good morning Nuree, 
 
I tried calling you but your mailbox is full. I had a conversation with Dr. K Tori this morning. He related to me that he feels that the candidate behaved very unprofessionally. Dr. K Tori gave an option to Mr. Timmons to contemplate his hiring options before accepting his offer. Mr. Timmons accepted it and confirmed to Dr. K. Tori that his decision is final. Therefore, Dr. K. Tori will not cancel the nomination for this candidate. 
 
If you or Teaching Fellows office would like to give him a call he is open for a conversation.

Hi Bermet, 
 
FYI. Thanks for speaking with Principal Ktori about this situation. Best situation here would be for Principal Ktori to release Curtis Timmons so that he can be nominated by another school. The new hire commitment has been confirmed by both the university (coordinator called school directly) and the Fellow. 
 
As mentioned, Curtis has been informed not to sign this letter, as a resignation from the school means a resignation from the DOE, which would result in Curtis being withdrawn from the Fellows program. Please also note that the resignation letter doesn’t have Principal Ktori’s name printed anywhere. 
 
Thanks! Looking forward to hearing back with some good news!

Hi Tashirah,

Yes, if he signs the resignation, he’s resigning from the DOE, which does impact his status in the Fellows program. He would be withdrawn and it seems to me, Mr. Timmons does not want to withdraw, nor do we want to withdraw him from the program. 

I spoke with Bermet Myrzaly, HRD for 29Q015, and she will reach out to the school to get the school’s perspective on the situation. I’ve informed her that the best situation possible is to have 29Q015 release the Fellow and transfer him to your school. 

Once we are able to have him be nominated at your school, you’ll need to work with Field Services to push him forward in the process. He’s currently stuck on the dual employment stage (and thus not yet finalized on payroll at 29Q015) because he’s on another school’s TO as a para on leave without pay. 

Hope to have some good news soon!

Hi Tashirah,

Thanks for reaching out. I had to follow up with some of my colleagues, as we’ve been hearing about Curtis’ situation from different angles – HRD (you), his university, him directly. 

You’re right – the Fellow hasn’t yet finalized on 29Q015, and I’m not sure why he hasn’t since he was nominated on 12/23/16. I asked PS15’s HRD to reach out to me asap so once I have something to share – hopefully before the end of the day – we can determine next steps.

Good Afternoon:

The following teaching fellow was advised to submit a letter of resignation to 25Q015.  According to Mr. Timmons the Principal does not think he is a good fit for his school.  He was not staffed at 29Q015, so we asked that the principal cancel the nomination so 04M096 can pick him up.  The principal will not release him nor will let him stay in the school building.  He was informed not to submit a resignation letter.  He is also a para and submitted a resignation letter but 97M169, put him on an unauthorized LOA.  Do you know what is going on or advise on the next possible steps on getting Mr. Timmons hired at 04M096.

Days of 12/15 - 12/26 Issue with me working out of license/1st meetings with the AP about the curriculum
• I jumped through a lot of hoops to work in this class. First, I was working out of license as this was a General Education classroom of 20 students. I talked to the Brooklyn College liaison who said that I could work out of license if I work in license the following year.
After a lot strings being pulled I was approved to work in this particular class even though I am currently out of license.
• Mrs. Holstein gives me a quick tutorial on Think Central, gives me a password, username and then tells me to figure it out. This is the 1st year the school is using this program yet I must figure it out in less than 2.5 weeks. Also, the lesson planning template is a how to put a book in a bin lesson plan.   
• A very quick tutorial on Think Central along with logon information was given, then I was assumed to learn the program (without assistance) by my ‘start date’. Even though this program is new to all teachers/administration. Also, the lesson planning template is a how to put a book in a bin lesson plan.   

4th Day Jan. 6th  

   

1st Day Jan.3rd 
• The day before I spoke to the AP and she assured me the I would be eased into the classroom. The ATR would stay with me for an unspecified time, so I could get the gist of the classroom dynamics/environment. This did not happen.
• Tuesday the 3rd, I get to the school early and speak with Ms. Leary (The ATR) and tell her that I’ll be with her today. I had spent approximately 2 periods with the class and her that Thursday before the Christmas break. Prior to start time, the then she tells me, “I’m so sorry, I can’t believe they’re doing this to you, you’re on your own today.”
• I am told by the AP Ms. Holstein that I can’t introduce myself as the new teacher just yet, or call parents because Principal K’Tori is feeling you out right now.  
2nd Day Jan.4th 
• I’m gifted another student, a girl who has been getting homeschooled for the past month or so. I have at least 3 students who could use a one on one paraprofessional. Clearly, this class needs a para. Prior to me joining the class there were two teachers in the room together. I find that I am the 6th teacher since September, I was under the impression that I would be the 3rd. In fact, teachers in the building are telling me that I’m being set up to fail. 
• I find a problem with payroll as well. Apparently, I’m still registering as a paraprofessional. Per HR, I have 2 positions. 
3rd Day Jan. 5th 
• I learn that we’re to present a quick performance on College Readiness day during an assembly, which is scheduled for the 11th of January. 25 white tee shirts are purchased, and my wife & I decorate the shirts on the 10th of January until 1am. Winter intersession has just started at graduate school on the 3rd so I’m pretty much bombarded with getting the class together and my own schoolwork. I’m pretty much overwhelmed.
  4th Day Jan. 6th  
• The AP comes in and asks to see my lesson plan, 10 minutes before the end of the day. I inform them that I have it on electronic format. I’m then berated then told that I should always have to on paper. I was never informed of this unnecessary process. 
• I stay until 8:30 trying to clean and straighten up the room, which was left in such a state, I have to call my wife. 
• After getting home I think about all the things that I’ve been told by teachers and staff about the environment and administration at the school. I’m having a serious change of heart. From the “he listens in on you in the room by turning on the intercom in your room.”, to “He is the devil!”, to “I told you not to work here.”, I panic and on Sunday the 8th I then email the fellows to see if I can somehow get out of this situation. 

Week of Jan 9th – 13th 
• The fellows get back to me and tell me to wait it out and leave in June. Trying to be positive, I decide to stay; things can only get better.
• That Tuesday, my mom who has been holding from me her latest medical issue reveals to me that her doctor told her that she may need surgery to alieve the chronic pain she suffers from due to her spinal stenosis and sciatica.
• That Wednesday, I met with the principal to discuss a possible release mainly due to the news of my mother’s problems. Extremely bothered and cold, he explained to me that I had to either resign or he would have to fire me or a final step that if I could find a principal willing to hire me he would transfer me to that principal. He seemed to think that I was quitting the DOE when in fact I explicitly told him I now need to be in a school close to her. He asked if I had already found a school and when I said no, he chastised me as being indecisive and that will be my downfall. After the bombardment of insults and condescension, he told me that I had to make this move asap. I explained to him that I can’t resign or get fired because I would be kicked out the teaching fellows program and that I’ll see if I can find a principal. I emailed a principal that I previously interviewed almost immediately and told him the situation. He had a position and he would love for me to work there. 
• Thursday the 12th, during the day, the principal tried calling Mr. K’tori that late afternoon, the was no answer and there was no option to leave a message. 
• Friday the 13th, there were many attempts to reach Mr. K’tori, left messages with Principal K’Tori’s secretary. Again, no answer, and no returned calls. 
• With 5 minutes remaining until the end of the day, I receive the attached letter. This was hand delivered by Ms. Ali (Secretary) and the AP. During my talk with Mr. K’Tori, never did I once say that I would resign. I did not even accept that as an option. The letter is filled with incorrect information. Thinking on our talk, I can only think that he intentionally lied to ruin my chance to become a teacher. I believe he is retaliating as I accused him of taking my request personally (which he did as he turned aggressive once he understood that I was requesting to transfer). His language in the letter is accusatory and belittling. His dismissive attitude toward my very short stay actually highlights how unprofessional he acts.

Hi Trisitin,

I just wanted to check in with you about Chris Cummins.  I've learned from my correspondence with him that there was an issue with the OPI? (not sure what that means exactly), and so he's been temporarily reassigned to Committee on Special Education.  He is not yet back at X80, and so I haven't been able to meet with him or observe him.

He thought that the Fellows program was aware, but I just wanted to check in with you and see if there's anything I should be doing!
Many thanks,

Subject: NYCTF Cohort 28

Mr. Diaz,

I am a member of cohort 28. I am contacting you regarding security clearance from the OPI.
Following is an accounting of what has transpired over the last 3 days.

Thursday (9/15)

I was contacted by someone at the NYCTF informing me that there was a problem with my security clearance and that I should not go to training on Friday Sep 16.
I was told that someone from OPI would contact me tomorrow, Sep 16.

Friday (9/16)

No one from OPI contacted me Friday.
I called NYCTF and was told that I should try calling OPI.
I called OPI and was told by OPI to contact them via email.
I sent an email immediately offering my assistance and compliance in any way possible to expedite the issue. OPI did not respond to me.

Monday (9/19)

On Monday morning, I went directly to OPI's office at Court Street to attempt to provide any direct information I could and fill out any required forms.  OPI told me there was nothing I could do.

On Monday afternoon I called the NYCTF office and told them that I was getting nowhere.  I was told that there was nothing for me to do and that the Fellows would be working directly with OPI to settle the issue expeditiously, and that there was now a deadline being applied to my situation of Thursday, September 22-which if not met would mean my expulsion from the program.

Tuesday (9/20)

I received an email from OPI stating that they only got my fingerprints on the prior Thursday (9/15) and would get to my file, and that they were not aware of any deadline.  They also stated that it normally takes more than 1 week for a security review to be completed. It seems like the file might not have been looked at until today.

Later, I received an email from OPI informing me that I needed to complete 2 forms and return them by Sep 26. I completed the forms and hand delivered them to OPI today.  I came to the NYCTF office on the 3rd floor to discuss the issue and help try to solve it, but the office was closed and a sign was posted that the office would not be open until Sep 26.

It seems deadlines have been set that cannot physically be met, since the NYCTF office is closed and not working with OPI and OPI isn't working on a deadline schedule.  There must have been some communication breakdowns along the way.

I am fully invested in the program and have been giving 100% effort to the skill building classes.  Please do check in with Ms. Skinner and Betancourt on my class enthusiasm and participation.

I would like to speak directly with you to help rectify this issue as I am sure we can solve it quickly and keep me in the program that I love.  I look forward to speaking very soon.

I feel this initiative is creating a great opportunity for a Black man, such as me, to enter a classroom of any public school in New York City Department of Education and positively impact the lives of inner city youth academically. I also feel that I have grown professionally in being able to think critically and creatively in efforts to engage the youth and their family that I work in being able to meet their needs.

Ms. Barnkow,
 
It has come to our attention ",Professionalism,Inappropriate Email to Former Colleague,"Maria was sent an outplacement letter from NYCTF last week. On Friday evening she sent an incredibly inappropriate, vulgar and hurtful email to one of her former colleagues and a current Fellow, berating both him and their coach. I followed up with her via email to ask that she refrain from contacting any additional colleagues from the program and instead direct her communications to our team.",Professionalism,Professionalism Concern Letter,"Maria returned a call to Anna Kelly and myself (Sarah Whittemore) regarding her Professionalism Concern Letter. During the call i explained that some professionalism concerns had been brought to our attention that we wanted to review with her and listed these concerns (see letter). I asked Maria if she had had a chance to speak about these concerns with her Coach and she said that they had discussed the lack of preparedness for a lesson and her pushback on the Coach's feedback regarding a student in a Guided Reading group. She also shared that she felt she had learned from these mistakes and was performing well and that PST was going well overall. I stated that I was glad to hear she was accepting her Coach's feedback to improve her practice and outlined what we need to see from her in order to stay in good standing in the program (see letter). I also made it clear that this meeting was to make sure that there was no recurrence of these professionalism issues and that any recurrence could result in her removal from the program. We concluded the conversation by Maria stating that she understood, had no questions and me telling her the letter would be uploaded to her TT2 account this evening for her review. ",Professionalism,Phone Call,"I attempted to reach Maria today to issue a Professionalism Concern Letter. She did not answer, so I left a message asking her to return my call, and the front office will also reach out to schedule a time.",Pre-Service Training

I was very excited about the possibility of joining the Fellows when I applied for the first time, and still feel every bit as eager to participate. I’ve enjoyed working at M.S. 131 for the past 6 years and each year as I take on more responsibilities for training and mentoring students. I feel increasingly committed to a teaching career. Being a father of two children has furthered my interest in shaping and impacting young minds. As a product of public education and I feel a powerful sense of duty to give back. In terms of how I am a stronger candidate now, I believe having gone through the selection process before gave me a lens to observe teachers at my school with more critical insight. Now when I am fixing computers in a classroom, for example, I will try to identify what skills the teachers are using and ask myself if that’s something I used in my sample lessons. Although I have not yet been selected for the Teaching Fellows Program, I am still determined to be a teacher. I am currently paying my way through graduate school courses in education as I work full-time and raise two children.

Subject: Attendance for two Fellows

Hi Katie, 

Hope all’s going well in SBS today! 

I wanted to follow up on two Fellows in your SBS group who reached out to you and/or our front office about attendance issues. 

1. Hadiyah Najeeullah – who notified us of having to come into SBS late on 8/31 and will miss one hour of SBS. Please mark her as absent for 8/31 – we have logged her reason and will take that into consideration. But for now, this will count as a personal day – of which she has 3 total. 

2. Magala Bien-Alme – who notified us that she will need to leave SBS today, 8/30, at 2:00pm for a court appointment. She should also be marked as absent as she will be missing a full SBS. 

Let me know if you have any questions about this - I’ll also be around SJU today (in a red dress) if you have any concerns. 

Best, 
Dana ",Pre-Service Training,Attendance ,"""I spoke with a Program Associate named Dana, and inquired about all the  components of Attendance. She advised me to contact Teachers Fellow thru the contact form to inquire.
Tues August 30th, - I have a Mandatory parent meeting at my sons school. This will detain me, and as a result of it I will be 1 hour late to the Skill Building Session. 
Tues October 11th - I will be absent from PST, due to my son having NO school that day.

Thank you in advance,
Hadiyah Najeeullah""",Pre-Service Training,,,,,,,,,

I applied to the Dec. 3rd deadline which means that potentially many candidates that applied to the Oct. 22nd deadline before me could actually be less qualified than I am in Math but they were chosen on a rolling enrollment basis and met at least the minimum requirements for the Math Immersion Program which is only to have taken and received a grade of B+ or better.  I have taken many math classes as part of my undergraduate preparation for a Computer Science degree where I received Summa cum laude honors, departmental honors and induction into the Pi Mu Epsilon math honor society in the year that I graduated.   I also was a math tutor in my college's math and computer science lab.  I have also been working as a substitute teacher in a low income community of Port Chester, NY.  I  mostly work with students at the middle school level and have been doing so since September of 2015.  I especially enjoy the assignments working to cover the math and science teachers.  When I taught my lesson on Selection Day, I thought that I did a very good job, but my lesson did run a little longer than the five minute allotment given to each candidate.  I would like to have another opportunity to impress the fellowship selection day judges.  I know that I can be a very successful teacher and become instrumental in raising the academic achievement levels of all my students, but particularly those from low-income communities.  I really do think that I would have been chosen to participate in the 2016 cohort fellowship if I had applied during the October 22 deadline group of candidates.  However, I was not aware of the program until the October deadline had passed.  When I was sent an email to participate in the selection day events, I was assigned a subject area of Biology.  I had pointed out that I really am much more qualified to become a NYCTF math candidate instead of a science (biology) candidate.  It was explained to me that many of the accepted applicants from the October 22nd round of  applicants might have been candidates that had indicated Math as their subject preference and that when the the December 3rd round came, there were very few math openings left to be filled.     I would like to try again to impress the fellows that will judge the next round of selection day candidates.  I am extremely passionate about becoming a math teacher and want to teach at the secondary school levels and contribute toward making a positive impact in the lives of these students.  I know that if I were given another chance I would make a more powerful impression this time.

I feel that the lesson plan I did was successful due to the feedback I received from both fellow candidate's and the instructors that lead the day. 

Recently, I was sent the ""District 75 interest"" email and was ecstatic to know I was so close in the running. I MISTAKENLY answered the question pertaining to choice of grade level as ""1-6"" when I wanted /intended to select ""either grade level"". I am currently a Math Middle / ""High School"" Teacher Assistant in a special needs school and it is my desire to continue on this path.

I applied 2 months ago and did my lesson plan March 26, 2016. This experience has left me humble, paced and a passion of perseverance. It is with sincerity that I ask for the opportunity to once again showcase my potential in the classroom. 

I have successfully completed all the required workshops, received clearance through the Department of Education, (DOE) and the Department of Health, (DOH). I am studying for the EAS and ALST exams and have obtained the LAST exam. I plan on continuing my degree in Special Education and hope to be instrumental in one of the low-income classrooms in District 75 as a NYC Teaching Fellows.

Trying to get a Master's degree while learning how to teach; and not just teach, teach underprivileged or disabled children in economically challenged areas.  Plus I'm married with two kids.  I thought about how hard it would be; how scary it would be to walk into a school class room to try and teach young children.  I thought about the long hours, the stress, and all the complications... and I said why not me.

I am writing to tell you that Thomas Pokorny (Cohort 28) is not in good standing as a CCNY student, and I would like to advocate for his outplacement from the NYCTF program.

The due date to submit applications to get fellows into our system (get them CUNYfirst accounts, register their immunizations, get them registered for classes, get their IDs, etc.) was August 12.  To date, Thomas Pokorny has not submitted his CCNY application.  I emailed him several times between August 10 (to remind him his application would be due the 12th) and August 25 (the first day of classes) to strongly urge him to complete his application as a requirement of entering our program.  He assured me he would tend to this.  He showed up for the first day of classes on August 25 having not completed the application.  I sent him directly to our admissions team who walked him through every step of the application process, and he assured us he would complete his application that evening.  Thomas Pokorny has not even logged into our system to access his application since August 11, 2016.  Because he has not submitted his application or his immunizations, Thomas does not have a student ID number, is not registered for classes, and is completely out of compliance with our requirements.  I have emailed him twice since August 25 to ask him to submit his application, and he has ceased to respond to my emails.  I also asked his professors to have him stop by the admissions office and to contact me, and he has not done so.  We find these behaviors and lack of attentiveness to a very crucial aspect of our admissions process completely unprofessional and not in keeping with expectations for CCNY students or of NYC teaching fellows.

Since Thomas cannot be registered for classes and has not submitted his application or immunizations and is not cooperating with requests for action (or indeed responding at all to those requests), he is not in good standing with us.  Please let me know the next steps.

Thank you,

Hi Samantha,

Thank you for your message. We are sorry to hear about your medical issues.

We recommend reaching out directly to the DOE and your university coordinator for more information on taking a leave of absence. If you do take a leave of absence, please notify our office so that we can indicate it in our records. Please keep in mind that if you resign from your current position, you are also resigning from the DOE, and will no longer be eligible to remain in the Fellows program. 

If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out via the Contact Form or give our office a call weekdays 3-5PM at (718) 935-4147.

Best,
Heather
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please be advised that effective today, I will be applying for a leave of absence as I have been experiencing some medical issues as a result of a disability that I have. I went in to see my doctor today and it was recommended that I be on limited physical activity in order to attend to my health. I also have a letter from my doctor stating this and am able to provide to your office should you need this as there was no option to upload the letter here via the contact form.I also plan on resigning from my current position at the school I am employed at to focus on my health with the intention of seeking a position at another school once I am better.All for your information and guidance.Samantha Brijmohan

Hello Lynda: 

I've decided that I'll part ways with the Teaching Fellows. It's been a very difficult decision given that I have invested so much and come so far but I think it is what's best for me given the circumstances. I will plan to send an email to the principal explaining that I am resigning. Is there anything else I need to do apart from letting the Fellows know as well?

With that being said, I thank you very much for all of your help thus far. Please keep me in mind should you hear word of any employment opportunities and feel free to pass my resume around.

Many thanks,

",University,Wants a Medical LOA,"In numerous touch points with Brooklyn College, I was informed that Samantha wants to take a medical leave of absence. Although she provided a letter from her doctor stating the needs for an LOA, she was informed to contact the medical leaves office as they are required to observe her and make the decision. When she contacted the office, she stated that they would not grant her a leave because she recently started the position.

Hi Lynda:

So I contacted HR this morning and they basically said that the leave manager closed my application based on the fact that I started working on Jan 3 and because I was applying for a leave of absence so shortly after my start date. I told them that I have a legitimate reason for applying for this leave as I have a disability and how can they just close my application without reviewing it in its entirety or without reviewing my doctor's note. They basically said that's just how they do it.

They told me to call my union...to which I told them that the union was who advised me to apply for the leave of absence in the first place. I basically got off the phone with no substantial assistance so I now need to reach back out to the union. This is becoming more frustrating...I don't understand how they can just close my case out without a proper review of the reason that I am applying for the leave in the first place.

Additionally, since last Thursday when I sent a note to my principal stating that I will be applying for a leave of absence based on the advise of my doctor, she never replied.

I tried calling you earlier but Naomi said that you were not in office so I decided to drop you this note instead. Apologies for the length.

Many thanks,
-Sam

Dear Lynda: 

I decided to log on this morning to see what the status of my leave of absence application states and noticed that it says it was administratively closed. I have no idea what this means. I will try to call HR tomorrow.

Just sending this as a FYI...screenshots below.

Thanks,

""Hi David,

We are reaching out in response to your attendance request. According to our records, you were absent from Skill-Building sessions on 9/27 and 23 minutes tardy to Skill-Building Sessions on 10/17. As you know, any tardy exceeding 20 minutes is counted as an absence for the day. With the two additional absences on 10/18 and 10/19, this puts your attendance record at 4 absences.

Given the nature of your absences on 10/18 and 10/19, we are granting an exception to the threshold rule, and will allow for these 4 absences. Please know that moving forward, you will not be able to miss any additional days for the duration of pre-service training. 

Please make sure that you check-in with your Lead Instructor and Coach for any work you may have missed while you were out. 

If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out via the Contact Form.

What veteran teachers say is true, the students make the work worthwhile. During the start of the second year at the San Francisco Friends School, I had a bi-racial, African American, kindergarten student who was adopted by a single gay dad. He was the minority in the classroom. No child likes to feel like they are different and have the reputation of being ""the bad kid."" He had a lot of behavioral issues which I tirelessly tried to correct. In the end, I made up a personalized behavior plan that would get more buy-in from a disobedient, impulsive student. I knew he loved soccer and sports in general, as way of letting out the conflicting emotions he was still too young to articulate. I feel that the most difficult and challenging students push you to your limits, and help you improve your practice exponentially.

In conjunction with the Workman's Circle Community Education Initiative in Westchester, I devised and delivered an extra-curricular program on storytelling and baking knishes (the topic of the nonfiction book I wrote) for children of diverse abilities, ages 5 to 12. My program focused on engaging students with all their senses, and invited them to choreograph a processional to usher the dough into and out of the oven.

Since 2001, I have had the chance to firm up my own aspirations as well. I keep coming back to education as the field where I can make a mark.

We debriefed about Tuesday's observation and Elizabeth's concern with her rating, as well as her recent placement. Elienn expressed concerned with Elizabeth's professionalism. She also explained that she mediated a conversation with Liz  and her CC this morning and that both Liz and her current CC expressed that they do not feel they can work together. Liz is currently teaching in Elienn's classroom (as of today). 

Elienn feels strongly that a PIP is the best next step for Liz. Elienn will be in touch with me about scheduling a meeting to discuss the PIP. ",None,email from fellow concerning collaborative coach,"This morning I received an email from Elizabeth communicating concern about her placement and request for a placement change. Her email expresses that she does not feel supported by her collaborative coach. She indicated that there was a meeting with her CC and Lead Coach in which she says she did not feel heard. 

I responded to her email explaining that I am not in the position to weigh in on this situation, but will reach out to the Fellows Program. I forwarded Elizabeth's email to my manager Sarah. ",None,request for another observation,"After my observation of Elizabeth and debrief with her collaborative coach, Vicki Herrera, Elizabeth asked to speak to me. Elizabeth explained that she felt her ratings (CC:2, EC:2, DL:2), was not fair. She explained that she has been trying really hard, that she was switched to PS 28 only a month ago and that her first observation was only 10 days ago. Elizabeth also stated that she does not feel support by the fellows program and again that she feels it unfair to be observed so soon after the first round of observations. 

I responded by saying that it was right for her speak up and advocate for herself, and that I would touch base with her lead coach, Elienn Rodriguez and my manager, Sarah Whittemore.

After leaving PS 28, I emailed Elienn as follows:

""Sorry I missed you today, I stopped by your room at about 1:15. I had to leave shortly after to get to another meeting. For the most part observations went well today. Liz Davis stopped me to talk about her rating. She was very upset and it seems she needs more support.  I told her I'd be happy to talk to you, as well as my TNTP manager. Are you free some time after 5 or tomorrow morning between 10 and noon to chat?""

A call with Elienn was scheduled for Wednesday at 11:30am; Elienn then had to reschedule for Thursday at 3:30pm. 

On Wednesday I did speak to my manager Sara about the observation and my conversation with Elizabeth. We agreed that the next steps would be to discuss this with Elienn and, if Elienn agreed, she would explain that I would come in for another observation, with the understanding that ratings could go down. 

I plan to talk to Elienn Thursday afternoon.",None,request for second observation,"Elizabeth stopped by the office today and said that she feels like her second observation was completed too quickly after her first observation, and she wants the opportunity to re-do her second observation. She said that she is concerned about her overall score, and wants to make sure that she passes PST. She also said that she felt her FEM was biased against her as the FEM said that she saw Elizabeth on the subway and liked her outfit.

For more context, she had her first observation on 10/6, and her second observation on 10/18. She told her FEM after the evaluation that she had her first observation 10 days before, and the FEM told her that if she had been informed, the FEM would have pushed the observation back. When I asked why she didn't reach out, she said she didn't feel like she should have to do that. 

When I explained the process of evaluations and how scores work, she told me that it was unacceptable for her to not have a second chance at her observation, and asked to speak to someone else aside from me as I was not listening to her and was only telling her the rules of the program. I ended the conversation saying that I would follow-up with staff and reach back out to her, but set the expectation that all Fellows have equal opportunities for three evaluations, and NYCTF does not offer repeats of evaluations.
",Pre-Service Training,request for new training site,"Elizabeth wrote in on 9/16:

""I love the kids in Tara Downing's class at 176X and Tara as well, she's been great. That being said, I now require a reasonable accommodation. 

I am commuting over 2 hours each direction every day. I don't have time to take care of myself. I don't have time to get myself groceries, when I do make it to the store, my ADD brain is so fried from commuting I buy the wrong things. I don't have time to wash my hair. When I get up before 5 a.m. in the mornings (extra to walk my dog), the hot water in my building is not yet on for the day.

The rule about not having Fellows commute more than 1.5 hours is in place for a reason. The DOE must accommodate me as I am truly unable to cope with the stress of my commute. I have two learning disabilities myself: I'm dyslexic and I have ADD. I disclosed these to the NYC DOE when I applied for Fellows. I can provide a doctor's note to verify these two. Although I can write a 100-page research thesis no sweat (as I have done twice), commuting, is basically my Achilles heel. As an adult, it has been very important to me not to fall back on using my disabilities as an excuse. Trying to make this commute work, and the fact that I am now demanding a change bc of my disabilities, has made me feel frustrated, stupid, and incompetent in a way I have not felt in many years of adult living. My mind is so stretched trying to cope with a daily four hour travel schedule, I don't have any mental energy left over at the end of the day to plan my meals, pack my bag, get my dog set up for the day, etc. I've lost over 5 lbs in the past two weeks since I started this. If I were back home in San Antonio, TX, I could drive over 300 miles to Harlingen in the Rio Grande Valley, and I could make this drive once a day. If the DOE wants me to commute so far, it should pay to relocate me, as other companies / government organizations do when employees are assigned to a different city.

Two things I want to address:

1. When we applied to the Fellows, a question that was stressed multiple times was something like: If the DOE were to change you to a different subject / grade level at the last minute, even if you'd already planned your lessons for the year, are you flexible enough to rise to that challenge? I answered YES because I am. Contingency planning is exciting to me. This situation now w the commute: this is not me rising to a challenge. It's allowing myself to be taken advantage of, plain and simple. 

2. Our wonderful PST instructor Marilyn Robinson reminded all of us Fellows last Tuesday that multiple folks are commuting 2+ hours. This makes me sad, and really it is too bad that so many of us are willing to do that. But it does not mean, just because others are in my boat, it does not mean I should continue living with this kind of stress. The rules are the rules: no commute over 1.5 hours. I'm doing my part to follow the Fellows' rules. But the DOE needs to do its part too. The DOE and I, as an NYC Teaching Fellow, are in a contractual employer-employee relationship based upon mutual trust and accountability, and the DOE is now violating this contract by demanding of me this commute. 

As I require a reasonable accommodation based upon both my disabilities and upon the DOE's contractual obligation, I expect the DOE will relocate me to a closer school to my home at 1042 Bergen St. Brooklyn by Monday, September 19. I'm at my school now in the Bronx, and I have my phone on and in my back pocket. My number is 929 228 9494 and I want to hear from the DOE Fellows today, and I want to hear information about how we can move forward together to fix this problem, so that I can be unencumbered in my efforts to do the good teaching work I know I am capable of doing. 

 

Sincerely,

Hi again Ms. Bennett,

Thanks for the quick reply in the last email. Since I understand that teaching fellows has to show that this letter was issued to me can I request a physical version of this letter?So that you can take the electronic version offline.  I can go the the main office on Thursday after work and in that regard it would still be noted on my account. 

My biggest concern is that the FEM will see this letter and make pre-conceived notions without knowing everything full-circle. 

I hope you don't think ill of me for asking but I would like to request a physical letter. 

Sincerely,

Ashaunte Raquel

She requested that I not post the PCL to TT2 because that ""sounded serious"" and she was worried it would look bad. I indicated that this would not be an option. She said she wished she never said what she did about the PIP, and told me that she did move forward with it after making that comment. I assured her this was a positive step.

Hello my name is Karina Almonte. I am one of the fortunate candidates selected for the Teacher’s fellow fall cohort. Due to my past experience as a paraprofessional and my preferences on my application, I was placed in the District 75 moderate/severe special education 7-12 program. After working with this population of special needs children I realized I wanted to be more than just a paraprofessional. I wanted to teach and help more students as well as their families.   I did my best in completing all of my requirements on time, even when for the most of it I was out of the country with very limited internet. My only concern this whole journey was my mother. A year ago she had a heart attack while at work. Since then I have been accompanying her to her cardiologist appointments. She has been unsure of whether or not she was going to continue working due to her conditions. However I continued with my application and acceptance process until further notice.      I feel terrible for waiting last minute for this deferment but please understand i was so thrilled at this teachers fellow opportunity and was more than sure I was going to do it. My schedule was free and flexible and I was looking forward to this new experience. It turns out starting this September my mother will not be working anymore. For some time my family will be financially unstable. I will have to go back to work to help support my household until hopefully things get back to normal. I wish i would have known sooner because I know any other person would have been more than grateful for my spot in the program. I feel terrible to have to pick between myself or my family.   I do not want to lose this amazing opportunity granted by the Teachers Fellow program but personally and financially i will not be able to do this program this fall. I would greatly appreciate if I could defer my enrollment for a year. I am sure that by then I should be able to join the program and give it my all. Thank you so much for everything.",Deferral,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, I have done more reading and writing in my own personal life which has increased my skills level and strengthened my ability to impart knowledge to others.

""Hey guys, I have a friend who is an ESL teacher for the fellowship and went through this experience last year. She gave me some information so I thought I would share it with you...
""First of all, don't get stressed. This is a great program but you have to be super independent and like blindly agree to their feedback in order to pass PST. As soon as you're done with PST you can do whatever you want anyway. That being said, everything with NYCTF is unclear, and they're borderline impossible to get ahold of. BUT you'll be fine, so just try to go with the flow and don't get stressed. I didn't know they did a program that started in August, mine was all of last summer and we taught summer school so I think it's going to be a little different than my PST experience. In terms of skill building sessions, teach like a champion is their bible. You don't actually have to read it because they will drill all of it in your mind. Also def don't miss a day or be late because they'll hold it against you. 
When you're looking for a job, try to get a school with a huge ELL population so you're not the only ESL teacher.
The PST schedule is not as intense as they make it seem, definitely not 12 hour days everyday. Observations do suck but the city is putting so much money into the NYCTF and on you getting through so as long as they see that you are trying and listening to their advice you will be ok. I did PST in Washington heights which was a pain to commute to but the people were great and their are daily happy hours after PST. 
The problem with the CST and the other tests is that their isnt really a way to study, they are more common sense but they expect you to know what someone who studied education in undergrad would know.""""",High Expectations,professionalism,"Jacqueline called 8/11 to request that we send her the fingerprinting nomination email. I informed her that we are unable to expedite the process and would be able to provide an extension if she does not receive the email by the deadline. She stated that she read on the Facebook group that we were able to do this for another Fellow while they waited. I informed her that we could not do so. She then said that I was a liar and she knows that we can do it. I reiterated that we cannot process the request at this time. She stated that she was going away this week and needs the email. I reiterated that we will be able to work with her to provide her a brief extension so that she can complete fingerprinting. 

During the call, she was unprofessional when speaking to me. Later that afternoon she came to the office in person with the same request, and staff informed her we were not able to expedite the process.",Professionalism,,,,,,,,,

I reached out to him letting him know that I am confused as to what happened at the site, and that I am available if he wants to discuss the issue further.  The fellow did not attend SBS on Tuesday (it was his first absence) and he has not replied to my message.     
",Withdrawal,PCL Call,"I also sat in on the PCL call to Will Lasky with Anna Kelly. During the call Anna shared that NYCTF had some concerns about Will's handling of an autistic child in a 6:1:1 classroom and repeated incidents of raising his voice to his  Coach and a Fellow at the school. Will acknowledged that he did lose his temper when dealing with a stressful situation with a student and ""snapped"" at a Fellow, which he later apologized for. He denied raising his voice or displaying outward anger towards colleagues. Anna and I said we would note this in the issue log, but reminded him that it is imperative that he act in a professional and courteous manner - even in stressful situations - and especially in front of students. Will said he understood and would do so moving forward. ",Professionalism,Program Phone Call,"I spoke with Will to issue his Professionalism Concern Letter and set expectations for professionalism in the future. We discussed the incident with the student, the Fellow, and the Coach, and that for the future of PST he will need to be professional in all interactions and uphold his school and NYCTF's guidelines for working with students.

He shared his perspective that he is in an unusual situation regarding this challenging student and that other Fellows in his school are not dealing with students who are as challenging. He also shared his perspective that the Fellow who addressed his unprofessionalism was only doing so from a place of wanting to show that she had superior knowledge to his - I reiterated that regardless of the circumstances, it's essential that he remain professional in all future communications with Fellows, staff, and students.",Pre-Service Training,,,

Odette and I outlined the professionalism concerns that came up throughout the fall and explained how important it was for Elizabeth to uphold them moving forward and throughout her teaching career. She was extremely apologetic and called out everywhere she was at fault--and she was very thankful to have met expectations for the program. She still seemed to have some mindset challenges (saying her new school was in a rough neighborhood and the principal was desperate for her), but it was clear that she understood the weight of her professionalism concerns, which she hadn't before the conversation.",Professionalism,response to PCL,"Ms. Shauna Hart,

I apologize for missing your calls last evening. I have received the professional concern letter on my teacherstrack and have spoken with my coach regarding this. The letter states that I “demonstrated resistance to feedback upon receipt of my PIP” on 11/3. Last night I called my coach who said this must have been written in error. My coach said that I “have been really good at implementing feedback” and she never told Odette otherwise.

Regarding the second statement in which Odette wrote that I “indicated to my coach that teaching in D75 is glorified babysitting”: I never made such a statement and this is not representative of my feelings toward teaching in D75. I am horrified that this statement would be attributed to me. On 11/17 I spoke with my Coach Stefanie about my experience visiting 12:1:4 classes. I told her the students reminded me of my cousin who was given home instruction due to profound functional and intellectual disabilities. Stefanie responded to this by saying home instruction is better because 12:1:4 classes are for glorified babysitting. Her statement made me uncomfortable and I said “there has to be a way to teach them effectively” and she laughed and repeated that if you teach 12:1:4 classes you are a glorified babysitter and she stated that she would never teach a class “that low”.

Last night I spoke with Stefanie and she stated “Odette said we had to write the letter. I told her that you have been implementing all of the feedback I give you and she insisted we write a letter anyway.” Later in the conversation Stefanie said “Odette said we had to come up with things to put in the letter so I told her I did not think you want to work with low students in 12:1:4”.

The letter of professionalism states that I must consistently meet expectations for the remainder of pre-service training but I was sent an e-mail saying I am not allowed to attend the last day of PST. I bought educational games for all of my kids as “goodbye gifts”. I never said goodbye to the students. The students in PST are some of the most intelligent, enthusiastic and kind people I have ever met. The students did not deserve to be left in the dark with no formal goodbye. The students react strongly to changes in the classroom and they were never told I was leaving and it is heartbreaking to know that this abrupt transition may negatively impact their opinions about school and the trusted adults in their school environment.

I would like the opportunity to speak with you further regarding the implications of this letter and what actions are required on my part to successfully complete pre-service training.

Thank you for your time and understanding in this matter.

Yours very truly,
Elizabeth A. Gloeggler
",Pre-Service Training,medical condition,"I am undergoing treatment for lyme disease that went undiagnosed for several years.  Although I don't anticipate any more absences than allowed, in the event of a flare up of symptoms I may need an extra day or two off.

I have no intention of taking any personal days and hope that I will not need any time off at all. My overall health is very good but due to financial circumstances I will be changing my medication which could lead to a temporary resurfacing of symptoms.

I have a basic note from the doctor who is treating me but would be willing to allow NYCTF to speak with him further if needed.  I love the fellows program and the school I am placed at. I will continue to make every effort to arrive on time every day for the remainder of training.  I have not missed any days thus far.

In the event that I should have some medical issues related to my illness, I would like NYCTF to be aware prior to accruing any absences.

Thank you,

Hi Deirdre,

Thank you for your detailed email and sharing some of your reflections over the events that have taken place with Mr. Padilla and Ms. Austrie-James. I am happy to hear that you and Ms. Austrie-James have built what seems to be a respectful and trusting relationship where open and honest conversations and feedback can take place. I think this is critical for your growth and success as a Fellow. 

I have also made note of your objections to your PCL and the events described at your former Field Experience site in your file so that we have a record of your thoughts on the subject. Thank you for sharing those and, again, for your honest self-evaluation of what you have learned throughout this process so far.

Finally, thank you for providing me with the best day and time to call you this week. I will try to reach you by phone tomorrow at 3:30pm. 

Thank you and have a wonderful day,

Sarah

Good Morning Ms. Whittemore,
 
Thank you for the follow-up.   I do not have any questions about the professionalism concern letter, but I did have concerns about it - the letter was  based on false and defamatory information which has been damaging to my reputation and have placed my career goals at risk.
 
My new placement is working out well, although I have learned to be careful  of the questions that I ask.  Some of my questions have offended my collaborative coaches, though being offensive  was not my intention - however getting them to think about what is right was.
 
My current coach - Ms. Austrie James was offended by something I said, but she did not go to the extreme (telling a lie on me, in order to have me removed from the class)  that Mr. Padilla did.  
 
Instead Ms. Austrie-James spoke to me and used an analogy to explain why she was offended. 
 
This is the analogy she used:
 
She said imagine if I had a cat with a dirty litter box, and I know that a dirty litter box causes my house to smell.  She said then imagine that I have a visitor who comes to my home and asks me if I cleaned up my house today – she the question I asked her was offensive.
 
While co-planning a lesson, Ms. Austrie expressed her desire to impart upon the students that it was important to have friends.  In  response, I asked Ms. Austrie ....if a child has no friends, does that make that child a bad person?
 
 
In the case of Mr. Padilla, after sitting in his class where I observed the adults (not the children) being the source of chaos, I asked Mr. Padilla how could his students possibly learn in a classroom where he allows his paras to hold side and competing conversations? Mr. Padilla essentially responded that I had no right to ask him that question, that I should be an observer only, and that if I wanted to work for the Department of Education, I would have to learn how to keep quiet about what goes on in his classroom.
 
 
In both cases - and upon reflection I realized I asked the question with the intent to get my coaches to see, what in my opinion, was the error of their ways.  I wanted Mr. Padilla to see that his classroom was not effective for learning – which was why the children and the paras seemed to be disrespecting him and not listening.   I wanted Ms. Austrie-James to consider the impact that insisting that ‘everybody’ have friends might have on a child that has no friends, her approach might leave a child with no friends thinking he is a bad person because he has no friends.
 
However what I forgot, was that my purpose in being in their classroom is NOT to point out the error of their ways – because as Ms. Austrie-James amply pointed out – she already has a job (I'm the one trying to get one).
 
I did not consider that my collaborative coaches might be sensitive and become offended by my questions, but Ms. Austrie-James  informed me that she is sensitive and in the future she would like me to take her sensitivity into consideration when  co-planning a lesson - which I have agreed to. Ms. Austrie then admitted that  it hurt her feelings when, while co-planning,  I immediately stated that I did not want to begin the lesson with a video.  I did not want to begin the lesson with a video, because I was planning the lesson for my observation, and I was going to be rated on  ""strong start,.""  I did not think starting the lesson with a video would facilitate strong start, and I did not want to waste the little bit of planning time we had looking at the video when I already knew I did not want to use it.  But  Ms. Austrie-James explained that  she would have preferred it, if I  watched the full video first before dismissing it as an option.  I understand her position now.
 
 
My concern, as I have already expressed, is the manner in which Mr. Padilla handled his feelings, instead of just telling the Fellows that he did not want me in his classroom because he felt I was encroaching on his territory, he and his school wrongfully disparaged my professional reputation and my personal character resulting in the professional concern letter, which I do not feel is justified. 
 
The best time to reach me by phone is 3:30pm to 6:30pm except the days we have skill building sessions which was the case last Friday, and will be the case this Friday.  So tomorrow - Thursday between 3:30pm and 6:30pm would be a good time to reach me. 
 
Thank you again for contacting me.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Deirdre,

My name is Sarah Whittemore and I am a Site Manager with NYCTF. I wanted to follow up with you to see whether you had any questions regarding the Professionalism Concern Letter you received from NYCTF last month and also see how your new placement at X012 is working out. 

I had tried to reach you Friday night, but unfortunately the number you left does not currently have voicemail set up so I was not able to leave a message. Could you share a time that would work well for me to reach you at 571-393-7285 this week? Hopefully we can avoid some phone tag that way and connect soon!

Given this new information, Sarah Whittemore followed up and left a message with Deirdre just saying she wanted to check-in to see if she had any questions about the PCL and how her new site was working out. Sarah also reached out to Deirdre's FEM to let her know she could reschedule her observation visit for Deirdre for the week of October 11th. Deirdre's FEM for Round 2 will be told to wait to evaluate her until the end of the cycle.

I received an email from my fellow Kamara Cupidon regarding her phone conversation with Ms. Bennett and receiving a PCL.  She expressed her concern with the issues raised by her lead coach and asked for advice on how to best handle the situation.  We spoke on the phone later that evening.  She expressed to me that she was surprised to receive the call/PCL.  She informed me that she was upset, cried and expressed to Ms. Bennet her frustration on how the situation was handled.  Afterwards, she was able to take time to think about her initial reaction and upon reflection she stated that she should have composed herself more during the conversation.  She regretted not handling the phone conversation in a more professional manner and wanted to express her perspective.  I let her know that I am there to listen and provide guidance and the following was discussed:

She expressed to me that she felt she was not given an opportunity to defend or respond to the issues raised in a formal manner (outside of the phone conversation).  She seemed honestly confused about the NYCTF protocols and she seemed confused on why the issues were raised when she thought she had been doing well at the school site.  I took the opportunity to explain to her that receiving a PCL is part of the process in reviewing and addressing any issues raised and that this document is meant to provide clear next steps on how to continue to improve.  I explained to her that the PCL does not mean that she has been determined to ""Fail"" PST and that her progress will be reviewed again.  I informed her that the PCL was addressing the issue of professionalism and that it does not take away from her great work during SBS or the successful ratings that she received from FEMs. I advised her to focus on her next observation and work towards doing her best with her class and coach.  

She then told me she was concerned about her ability to attain an interview/job offer.  I reassured her that there will be opportunities to interview after she successfully completes PST.  I informed her that there will still be schools looking for teachers after Nov.21st and that I had confidence in her ability to continue to work at her school site and do well at her next observation.  I informed her that I understood the PCL and phone call was unexpected but that it is vital for her to show her professionalism and to not let this effect her work at the school site.  She said that she was able to reflect (regrets being upset and crying on the phone) and is able continue to work within the program to the best of her ability.  She stated that she truly enjoys working with the students and that she has a great working relationship with her collaborative coach and would want to continue .  She also stated that (although, she is still confused about the issues the LC raised) she will be professional with her lead coach and do her best to work successfully at the school site.  I again, advised Kamara to focus on her upcoming observation and maintaining the level of professionalism she has always shown me and her peers in SBS. I informed her that I would write a note about our conversation in teacher track2 and that I would express her concerns via the log.  She thanked me for my time and stated she will focus on her work with her class.  ",Professionalism,PCL Conversation,"I spoke with Kamara this evening about issuing her PCL. She got very upset and angry with me and yelled at me for 20 minutes about how the coach had lied and she has been completely professional. She indicated that the coach was giving her mixed directions and telling her not to submit lesson plans then to submit them. She told me she recorded a conversation with her coach because she feels her coach has been intentionally giving her mixed directions and not being clear about expectations. When I expressed compassion for her frustration she told me that I do not have any and that it is a terrible thing to do to put a negative item like this in someone's file. I indicated that it is not meant to get her fired, just to ensure she knows what is expected of her for the remainder of the program. She told me that I am trying to do her harm by moving forward with this action, which I assured her I am not. When I told her she should take some time to cool down she told me it wouldn't make a difference, because I don't care about her feelings or about the truth and I am going to just post the PCL anyways despite her not having done anything wrong. She continued to yell at me and cry and eventually stated that there would be no point in our following up since I am going to take this action regardless. She stated that she should just quit. She expressed strong anger and frustration towards her coach, so I would anticipate this may have some negative repercussions at school.",Professionalism,absence,"""I am required to have a medical procedure completed on the morning of September 13, 2016.

I apologize for the inconvenience. However, I have been without a phone for several weeks, plus I am working two jobs at the moment.

Therefore, I am unable to accept this teaching position with Catherine & Count Basie Middle School 72 at this time.

Dear Charlene,
I have been emailing Lasasha repeatedly but did not hear from her.  She was placed late at a school – 28Q072 Catherine & Count Basie Middle School and so I needed to assign her to a field supervisor.  She did not respond to my emails.  However, this morning she called.  
 Lasasha never started teaching at 28Q072, was unhappy with the school, and has continued working as a teacher at a charter school.  She also has not attended classes here.   
I indicated to her that she needs to notify TFs of this and that at this time we need to drop her from the program.  She agreed that this would be best at this time. 
Lasasha, you will need to come into Pace to officially drop your course with no penalty otherwise an F grade will appear  on your transcript.  Please do let me know when you can come by.  Our office is open 9 – 5.
Best,

",University,Didn't report to work,"I received a voicemail from M.S. 72 stating that Lasasha Oyo was slated to start teaching on Monday, April 3. She did not report to work and has not been in contact with the school yet. I reached out to Heather at TNTP to put this on her radar. I also reached out to Pace to see if Lasasha has been in contact with them because when we last spoke about Lasasha, she was not attending coursework. 

I also called MS 72 back but did not get in touch with the Principal, so I left a voicemail. ",Job Search,Not in Coursework,"Lasasha did not attend coursework for the semester because she thought she was only allowed to do so once she secured a teaching position. I will follow up with Pat Kobetts at Pace to see if Lasasha is considered to be in good standing with the institution.

Hey Charlene,

All good questions.  I called her yesterday to inquire on her job search, and she told me she was not attending coursework. I asked about the messaging she received from Pace, and she said she was confused by it. I asked why she didn’t follow-up with the university if she was confused, and she was unsure.   

Thanks for following up with Pace!

Hi Heather, 

Lasasha received no messaging around orientation? Coursework? At what point did she realize she should be engaged in coursework?

Considering courses have been in session for almost a month, I doubt she’s in good standing, but I will inquire with Pace and get back to you. 

Best,
Charlene

Subject: C28: Lasasha Oyo

Hi Charlene,

I just spoke to Cohort 28 Fellow Lasasha Oyo who shared that she has not yet attended coursework at Pace University. She said that because she has not yet secured a position, she thought she should not attend university coursework. I wanted to flag this to you and see what her next steps should be. Since she hasn’t attended coursework to date, is she no longer in good standing?

Thanks,
Heather

We conveyed that she had not met performance or professionalism expectations and that we did not feel she was ready to teach kids. We kept typing it back to her performance and not her relationship with her coach. It was clear she was frustrated with the program and her coach. 

She said: 
- Ms. Abreu has been bullying her and not letting her get teaching time
- She brought up a past article about a Rose Abreu and a principal being fired for bullying (Parents demand board investigate, remove Franklin Township Principal)
- She said all her feedback from the coach was about her accent and saying ""red amber green"" instead of ""red yellow green""
- She said she wasn't able to teach for 8 days prior to the second observation (which her coach had attributed to her not wanting or being prepared to teach)
- She holds us responsible for placing us with this coach and not offering adequate and claims that's the reason she wasn't able to improve - we shared that her coach was changed and that multiple people supported her
- Claims her bad performance with her next coach is in a subject she wasn't as familiar with (but she also says this was her best performance too and her ratings went up with her next coach) - we mentioned her anchor scores as well, which are 2/2/1/1
- She claimed there was no response to her email to Jen (but Chris had gone and spoken to her for an hour after the email was sent)
- She said she hoped we would reconsider because she doesn't believe she was given adequate support and blames the Fellows office
- She also mentioned that she was ""forced"" to accept the PCL - Chris Lizette and Carly had a conversation with her about which interventions would be best for her",Withdrawal,PCL Conversation,"I spoke with Maria today about the PCL I am issuing her. She was receptive to the feedback and appreciative of the support we are providing her. She expressed concerns over her ability to successfully complete the program given her low performance evaluations, but I clarified that our conversation was specifically about the professionalism component and not the other. She is eager and excited with her new coaching placement and we discussed the fact that she needs to be prepared to collaborate with colleagues moving forward with whom she may not have the best personal rapport if she is going to be successful as an educator.",Professionalism,Issue with Coach,"Received the following e-mail from Jen, Maria's SBS Coach:

Just wanted to pass this along. Let me know if there's anything I can do!

Subject: Things are bad.
Jen, I'm so sorry to email you during the school day. I have had an awful interaction with Rose today. Is there anyone I can talk to? She is threatening again to give bad feedback to the fellows about me because I am always giving her 'pushback'. When I could see how angry she was becoming I kind of stopped talking thinking she would calm down but she kept haranguing me for another twenty minutes and then started demanding a list of ways she is not supporting me and started making bullet points. I asked her very respectfully if we could pause this conversation as i was not feeling comfortable with the high level of emotion. She pushed me for about another five minutes saying I'm late for a meeting but we are going to finish this, you just want to get out of talking about this.' This has been the worst interaction so far. She seemed to be trying to push me to the point of anger or tears even after I asked her several times if we could take a pause. 
I don't know what to do.

",Pre-Service Training,Follow Up Call for Support with Difficult Coach Relationship,"Maria Clegg called the office today and shared some additional concerns about her relationship with her Coach after the visit Lizette and Chris took to her classroom last week. She was hoping to speak to someone about these concerns as she feels she is reaching a breaking point and being retaliated against from her Coach. I asked her to share a little more about what was happening and recorded notes below. Maria presented a commitment to the program and serving her students and maintained a professional demeanor during the entire call. 

• One of Maria’s primary concerns was about getting adequate time to lead teach as her Coach was not providing her with the opportunities to do so that they has discussed. From Maria’s perspective, it seems the Coach is “refusing to provide her with lead teaching time” at this point. 
• Maria expressed feeling some retaliation from her coach after the visit from our program last week. It sounds like the Coach may feel like Maria is trying to undermine her, whereas Maria has felt like she is being bullied. She shared that in receiving feedback from her Coach and asking questions her coach responded that she was “sick of your feedback and pushback. I don’t want to discuss this.”
• This afternoon Maria shared that her Coach “very aggressively shared her frustrations with her” for 45min and when Maria asked if she could take a minute before class started again to collect herself, her Coach said she would tell the Fellows program that she had left the classroom. Maria said that she has tried to document these cases as they happen and has notes for reference.
• Maria also spoke about an instance in which her coach made her teach the exact same lesson again to the same group of students for reasons that weren’t made clear to her. She shared that students were frustrated to listen to the same material and it didn’t seem related to incorporating any additional feedback. 
• Maria ended by sharing that she was willing to do whatever it took to make things work but that she was reaching out in hopes of getting additional support to help manage this relationship as it seemed to only be getting worse. 

It sounds like Maria may have reached out to Jen, her LI, but my understanding was she hadn’t heard anything back from her yet.

Dear Tiffany,

It has come to our attention this week that you have provided your personal contact information to at least one of the students at your school, and have been communicating via text with at least one student, as well as discussing coming to visit the students at school. We would like to remind you of the rules regarding cell phone communication with students, specifically that you should not ever exchange personal information with students and that you and students should not be in contact via your personal cell number, email address, or other non-district sanctioned means.

Hello, 
I was just told that Tiffany is texting one of our students from Dana's class. She was asking if she could come in and visit the kids during 7th and 8th period today. We are just concerned that she is texting our students regularly.
Please let me know what I should do about this. She really shouldn't be texting the students.
Thanks,

",Professionalism,Email follow-ups to PCL conversation,"Following our PCL conversation, Tiffany sent me the following emails:

Good evening,

This is Tiffany Nieves again I'm just curious because we are allowed 3 absences in which we won't get penalized for any of them so how is it that that is in the letter you sent me? Also it's really crazy to me because I feel like the lead coach of the school and my collaborative coach are really trying to get me kicked out of the program because I haven't even been on my phone in the school since she addressed the situation with me and another fellow and honestly the kids actually feel like I help motivate them and they say i actually care about them more then most teachers so how do I go about addressing this situation with the lead coach and my collaborative coach because now I feel like I'm getting ganged up on and it's making me uncomfortable

Also I feel like that when it came to my observations I feel like she purposely told the FEMs that came to give me bad grades and she favors the other fellow more then me and I've been feeling like this for a while now I just didn't know how to address the situation because I really do work hard in this program and I feel like I made so much progress to then get shut down like this with this letter

I responded with the following, and forwarded the email chain to Dana Diaz and Kris Wasik so that it is on their radar as well:

Hi Tiffany,

This letter documents everything that has been recorded from the start of Pre-Service Training. I think it is great that you have course corrected on the use of your phone after the conversations you had with your coach. If this is the case then there is no further action needed from you other than continuing to do exactly as you have in complying with this request.

The absence on Halloween was not a concern because of the absence itself. The concern of your coaches was that they were each given different reasons by you as to the rationale for the absence, and the two messages did not overlap.

Rest assured no one is trying to get you kicked out of the program. If you are taking all necessary steps to fully engage with Pre-Service Training and your students there will not be any further action, this is just formal documentation from the program of the incidents that have already taken place. I am sure your coaches would be willing to discuss shared expectations further if you feel this would be helpful to allow them to support you during the remainder of your Pre-Service Training.

Best,

Mari

It is not enough to simply increase graduation rates. There are plenty of students who just slip by under the radar. They do not perform well enough for awards and honors. No one thinks to cultivate their talents and ability. However, they do not perform poorly enough for the system to catch them before they fail out of school. They are left uninspired by the education system and are left forgotten. This is something I know too well, having seen it happen to the majority of my family members. Now as young adults, they do not know what options are open for them and see school as a burden. For them education, is not something to want, but something to suffer through.

Subject: Anthony Napoli RECOMMENDATION to NYCTF: Victoria Segall
Importance: High

Good morning Professor Napoli,

It was wonderful to connect this morning and hear your voice!  I’m glad to hear that you are feeling well and enjoying being at the helm of the Fellows Program at St. John’s.  As discussed, I would appreciate any help recommending Victoria Segall for selection in the NYCTF (or the Collaborative Teaching Program through the City, if that’s the correct program).  To the extent Victoria could be selected to enroll in your program at St. John’s, that would also be terrific.  I obviously provided Victoria with a glowing recommendation of the Fellows, you and St. John’s.  I also am positive that you would enjoy having Victoria on campus and among your students.

Victoria applied using the email:  tsegall94@gmail.com and has completed everything required for the application process which included: a submitted application, a phone interview, a selection day event where she taught a five minute teaching sample, and a content assessment. 

I’ve also included Victoria on this email (cc), in case there is any follow-up information that you require.

I very much appreciate your willingness to recommend Victoria on my behalf.  Thank you!


Mike

When I called to follow-up, she said that she wanted to withdraw from NYCTF because of a situation with her school. She explained that she was hired by a school, taught for two days, and then was released from the position. She said she withdrew because shes was unhappy with that situation and didn't think she would have enough time to find another job. When I asked if she would be interested in remaining in the program if she had an extended job deadline, given the situation at her school, she said ""too little, too late."" I said I could follow-up if she were interested in remaining in the program, and she said she was not interested in remaining in the program. She verbally confirmed her decision to withdrawal, and I told her I would follow-up with an email.",Withdrawal,additional absence request,"Maha requested an additional absence to use for her pre-planned vacation. The team reviewed the request, and determined that an additional absence could not be granted. I informed Maha via email on 9/14, please see below:

Hi Maha,

Thank you for reaching out to our office.

We have reviewed your request, and have determined that we are unable to grant an additional absence to accommodate your vacation. Please know that all Fellows have three absences, or personal days, to use during training.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to our office.

I have completed and submitted my application. However, at the end when I attempted to go back and make the note that I am a recipient of DACA I was unable to. Is there anyway that you could make the note on my application? Or what else could I do to amend this. Also, in regards to my GPA, it seems that under the criteria requested of my transcript the GPA reflected will be a 3.192. This is good news as it wont hinder my application.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do at this time.

Also, when should I expect to hear of any kind of decision?

Best,
