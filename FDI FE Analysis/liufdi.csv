When you are ready to do your lesson, most do quiet down and listen. For those who continue to make noise, I suggest you walk over and stand near them and if that doesn't work, gently touch a shoulder. This often has the desired effect of quieting them down. Move around the room, do not stand in front for the entire class. By moving around you keep the class off balance. After you give directions students ask again and again what to do.

Some suggestions to help you 	Find the best Global teacher at your school and arrange to visit a few times. 	Go to the NYCDOE Employees, teacher page (schools.nyc.gov) Then find the box that offers New Teacher Support. The first two links will be extremely helpful for you. The first link will lead you to Edutopia's tool kit for new teachers and the second will take you to WeTeach NYC where you can search for lesson and professional learning resources.  	I also suggest Khanacademy.org to look for help Your lesson plan was good but you need to find ways to bring it to life and get the class excited and you must show how you are differentiating your lesson. You have a wonderful relationship with your students that shows they trust you and you care about them. This is the number one key in the making of a good teacher. I look forward to continuing our work together",Below Average,

Your lessons are planned and I can see the steps you want to lead the class through but the most important part is missing. That is the students understanding and retaining the information.

Your class likes you and will do whatever you ask them to do. If you accept a bare minimum, that is all they will give. The more you ask of them, the more they will give. This is an area of strength. You are very good at setting up and managing the classroom procedures from beginning to end which leads to no wasted time.  Absolutely no behavior problems are exhibited in your class.",Developing,Developing,Developing,"There was very little interaction between you and the students. In reviewing the Do Now, they discussed their answers and you were very encouraging in getting them to give full sentences but there needs to be a lot more interaction in the class. As we discussed many of your worksheets do not allow the students to think on their own. There is a lot of filling in the blanks which I understand is a good way for the class to get notes, but they can't seem to get past the coping of text when they need to answer questions in their own words. I would like to see discussion between the students and talk of the text read. I loved your annotated notes summary sheet that was on the smart board as the students were (silently) reading the text. This could have been used as an assessment if you reviewed what they annotated on their pages. Was there words they didn't know? What where the important themes discussed? What did they think they needed to know? These are some good questions that I would have liked to have known the answers too.  We not only need to have assessment threaded throughout the lesson, but the student need to be told how they are doing. I didn't see enough of this.",Developing,I need to get more specific examples on how you would change your lesson to make it more effective.

Establishing a culture for learning = 4 During the reading you were highlighting the text and used an overhead projector that picked up the text and put it on your smart board. This helped some students but I felt your class needed your physical presence by walking around the class more. Suggestion-have a student sit at your desk and read the text (silently) while moving the (already marked) pages as needed.  2c. Managing classroom procedures = 3 As the class began you were at the door with the student's folders, notebooks and the lesson for the day to hand out to the class. You need to have a late book handy for those that come in late. It takes your class a good 10 minutes to come in and settle down. I suggest you project a clock on your smart board so the class can see how much time to complete their activities. You gave out stickers to students on task throughout the lesson which motivated students to stay on task. 2d. Managing student behavior = 3 One young man came to class late and instead of him going straight to his seat and begin working he walked around offering his candy to others. You just continued your lesson as this was going on. Later you began to walk around the room and stand next to this same student which was a big help in keeping his behavior on track and focused. When one student was sharing, class was not respectful which you pointed out to class.          I was very pleased to see this class much more on track than in my past visits though I still think you need to make sure the 3 students in the back are never paired up together.",Effective,Effective,Effective,"3b. Using questioning / prompts and discussion = 4  You engaged the full class during this lesson. A lot of work was done in groups which they then shared out with the class. The questions in the Think section of their worksheet were good questions to get them writing but there could have been more discussion about the reading before they began the writing. 3c. Engaging students in learning = 4 You began the class with an excellent Do Now that the class got the opportunity to share out. This was a very good way to start the class and it led right into the lesson. If you can minimize the time wasted on the students entering the class and beginning their Do Now, you will have more time to complete your lesson. Your exit slip (which you were not able to get to) contained a self-checklist that had scaffolding to support the students engagement. 3d. Using assessment in instruction = 4 There was assessment evident throughout the lesson in the form of student writing and your verbal reaction to their writing. You moved around the room, met with and talk to everyone in the class.",Effective,You reflected on what you could have done differently in your class to make it an even better lesson.  This helped you make an accurate assessment of the lesson's effectiveness and the extent to which it achieved its instructional outcomes.

Using questioning / prompts and discussion = 2 You need to led the class into discussions. Each student is a valuable member of each discussion and has things to offer. By working discussions into the class the class will learn how to be an active participant who can learn from each member of the group. Try having them turn their chairs so they can see and talk to each other. Spend a little time going over some of the videos in Engageny.org/video-library.  I filtered my search by HS/Commencement level. Look at (teacher provides feedback to students and teacher engages students in discussion) which are part of Danielson Domain 3 that deal with instruction and the different components of instruction.  3c. Engaging students in learning = 3 Here is a definition of engagement. Within your class each student falls to some degree along this line of thought with one student on one end and another at the opposite. Felipe captures most of what is written to a high degree while the young lady shows a minimal amount of enthusiasm. The goal is to try and minimize the gap between the engaged student and the one just going through the motion with the hope of engaging all students to the degree of the most engaged. The degree of attention, curiosity, interest, optimism, and passion kids show or display when they are learning or being taught, which extends to the level of motivation they have to learn and progress in their education. 3d. Using assessment in instruction = 2 I am not seeing much assessment in your lessons. You return work to the students but do not give verbal feedback to them on the work done both written (the returned work) or verbal (work in class). Students need to get this feedback so the know what is going on. They also need to be aware of the assessment criteria used to evaluate their work. Please watch a few of the videos I recommended on student engagement and assessment that shows how a teacher both engages and assesses their class.",Developing,"Your lessons have been improving but not to the degree needed to see a great change. You have a lot of good things in place (classroom routines, students available to learn, your organization) but as discussed until you know more about the subject you will have a hard time getting the students to dig deeper into the lesson.
