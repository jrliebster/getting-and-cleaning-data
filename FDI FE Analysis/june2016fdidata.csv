The lesson objective stated that students will be able to identify proportional and non-proportional relationships using data tables. This objective represents rigorous and important learning within the math curriculum.    The instructional activity included a chart with time in minutes in one row, and miles per hour in the other. The students’ task was to determine whether or not the relationship was proportional, and then reduce the answer to its lowest form. A similar chart was offered for the number of copies from a copy machine and the charges for 25, 50, 100, and 500 copies. Students again had to determine whether or not the relationships were proportional. They also had to state which relationship included the lowest charge per copy. These activities represented a significant cognitive challenge to students. The time allotted for the activity was appropriate for all the students.  ",Effective+,Effective+,Effective,"Ms. Armand’s class exhibits characteristics of a cognitively busy environment where students and teacher both value learning. It is evident that Ms. Armand holds high expectations for her students, and most of them understand their role and expend efforts to learn.    Effective classroom routines and procedures maximized instructional time. Ms. Armand managed instructional groups effectively.    Student behavior was generally appropriate, however, this group of 7th grades exhibited a propensity to be chatty. Ms. Armand utilized planned ignoring and proximity of control, which reduced most of these off-task behaviors. A few students were chronic chatters, which led to a number of disruptions, eventually culminating in Ms. Armand threatening students that they would stay after school to complete their classwork.",Effective+,Effective+,Effective+,"Ms. Armand utilized directed and critical thinking questions to drive instruction and student understanding. She posed questions such as, “What is a proportional relationship?” and “Why are they proportional?” Her questions were largely single line of inquiry, however, she did attempt to get most of the students to respond to questions during the lesson.    All of the students were cognitively engaged throughout the lesson. The pace of the lesson, as well as questioning wait time, afforded students the ability to digest the information and formulate a verbal or written response. Ms. Armand grazed the classroom frequently to assist students during group work.    Assessment was incorporated throughout the lesson. Posed questions yielded responses from a number of students. Ms. Armand would not accept the first response, but successfully was able to tease answers from a number of students before settling on the correct answer. During independent practice, Ms. Armand actively circulated the class to check the pulse of understanding of each group.  ",Highly Effective,"Ms. Armand participated in our post observation conference following the lesson. She was praised for her solid presence and overall effective lesson delivery. She exhibited a command and a comfort level with the material, which supported student efforts in grasping and internalizing the lesson objective. Although the board space in this classroom is very small, Ms. Armand’s board work was very neat, understandable and sequential. Ms. Armand explained that her principal was in the process of getting her a computer projector. This would help Ms. Armand to display questions and notes on the screen, freeing up board space for guided practice and problem review.     Ms. Armand’s teaching was methodical. She task analyzed the work, allowing students to visualize the step-by-step process of analyzing and solving problems.    We discussed differentiation and student supports in general. She explained that she did not receive any information as of yet as to who her special education students actually are, although she does have her suspects.  I advised her to check her student’s programs to see if any of them receive SETTS, and then contact their special education teacher to get information about her students.     We had a discussion pertaining to positive behavioral supports in the classroom. Class rules were developed collectively, however, many of her students have difficulty consistently following them. It was noted that a significant component of behavioral supports includes praise and effective feedback from the teacher. She agreed that she has an issue in this area. She also added that her summer coaches also commented on her lack of praise. In addition to praising students for following rules and showing their best effort, we also discussed the use of employing effective feedback consistently. Evaluative comments from the teacher related to positive behavior and effective work efforts afford students a gauge to measure their own efforts and build their self- confidence. Ms. Armand possesses many of the traits and skills of an effective teacher. Including positive comments and feedback in her teaching will assist her tremendously.

Ms. Caramanica stated that her administration does not require a specific format. Ms. Caramanica’s lesson plan was sparse at best, and did not include differentiation of instruction or a lesson summary. Ms. Caramanica explained that this lesson was based on students’ ability to apply what they learned from the last couple of days, so she did not incorporate guided practice in her lesson plan.    Finally, we talked about the level of rigor in her class. We discussed increasing the rigor to challenge her students’ academic level to slightly above frustration level. She agreed, however, she explained that two of her students are emotionally disabled and they usually blow up or have meltdowns when the work is too difficult.   We talked about individualizing the expectation level, as well as the instructional materials to meet the academic and behavioral needs of all of her students.

Ms. Zheng assumed that students’ prior knowledge was sufficient enough to understand the work they were presented for interpreting functions of graphs and various applications of mathematical terms. Students were unclear and lacked a conceptual understanding of the functional vocabulary and terms. The lesson was incoherent and disjointed at times, with Ms. Zheng and a few students largely supplying information for the class.    Ms. Zheng’s board work was sloppy, and since the visual aspect of the lesson was so important, impromptu graphs drawn on the whiteboard were insufficient.     Assessment of student understanding and learning was haphazard and incomplete. Ms. Zheng reported that her students did well on the exit ticket.    Ms. Zheng and I spent some time discussing a math developmental lesson. We talked about questioning and the need for consistent redirection and a web of questioning.    Ms. Zheng is very bright and has some great ideas. She numbered each task with coordinates and used the students at those desks to stand when their coordinates were called. Depending upon the coordinates, different graphs and types were formed, much as parabolas, straight lines, zig zag, etc.     Ms. Zheng has been teaching for two weeks. With experience and confidence, I believe she will develop the necessary skills to be an effective teacher.  ",Average,5,4.666667,3.666667,6,4.166667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ms. Hogue and I discussed the need to generate and plan coherent lessons that include all the elements of a developmental lesson that last approximately 45 minutes. Lessons that continue into the next day, without offering a Do Now which revisits the lesson objective, tend to lack coherence and meaning. It is as if the lesson simply becomes a continuance of guided and independent practice sessions that lack continuity.    Ms. Hogue and I discussed areas for growth, including the development of classroom routines and procedures that add structure and maximize instructional time. In addition, we talked about the need to differentiate assigned work because of the varied ability levels in her class. Her high level students completed the independent work very quickly, while other students still required teacher assistance to complete their work. The down time for the higher level students resulted in off-task conversations and disruptions. We discussed the need to provide higher functioning students with supplementary work to challenge them and keep them engaged. This will afford Ms. Hogue much needed time to remediate and assist her academically challenged students.     Finally, we discussed the need for a final summary, which will allow students to reflect on the lesson and discern areas of understanding and misunderstanding. This will provide Ms. Hogue with a more accurate measure of student learning.     Ms. Hogue is a very calm, upbeat and caring individual.
